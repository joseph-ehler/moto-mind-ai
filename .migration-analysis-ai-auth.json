    "estimatedTime": "2-4 hours",
    "reasoning": "While the basic analysis suggests a low complexity due to the small number of components and files, authentication features inherently carry a higher risk and complexity due to security, data handling, and potential external dependencies. The lack of internal imports and subdirectories may simplify the migration, but the critical nature of authentication requires a more cautious approach, especially in reviewing security measures and compliance with data protection laws. The estimated time has been adjusted to account for these additional considerations.",
