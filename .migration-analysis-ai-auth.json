    "reasoning": "While the template analysis suggests low complexity due to the small number of components and files, the use of external libraries (Supabase) and React's context and hooks for state management introduces additional complexity. These aspects require careful extraction of domain logic and updating of import paths, especially considering the need to maintain backward compatibility. The migration also involves ensuring that the Supabase client is correctly initialized in the new structure, which could require adjustments beyond simple file relocation.",
