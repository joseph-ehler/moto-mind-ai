# Systematic Testing Plan for Dashboard Processing

## üö® **Current Status: NOT PRODUCTION READY**

**Issues Identified:**
1. Confidence calculation bug (0% individual + 86% overall = impossible)
2. Single test image validation (statistical malpractice)
3. No root cause analysis of fuel reading fix
4. No empirical accuracy baseline

## üìã **Required Testing Before Production**

### **Phase 1: Root Cause Analysis (This Week)**

**1.1 Confidence Bug Investigation**
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging to confidence calculation pipeline
- [ ] Trace through rollupValidation logic step by step
- [ ] Identify where 86% overall confidence is coming from
- [ ] Fix mathematical contradiction in confidence scores

**1.2 Fuel Reading Fix Validation**
- [ ] Log exact GPT-4o prompt sent to API
- [ ] Log raw GPT-4o response before parsing
- [ ] Test same image 5 times to check for variance
- [ ] Test with different fuel levels (E, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, F)
- [ ] Confirm fix is prompt-based, not random variance

### **Phase 2: Systematic Accuracy Testing (Next 2 Weeks)**

**2.1 Test Dataset Requirements**
- [ ] 20+ dashboard images from different vehicles
- [ ] Variety of lighting conditions (day/night/cloudy)
- [ ] Different gauge types (analog/digital combinations)
- [ ] Various fuel levels (Empty to Full spectrum)
- [ ] Multiple odometer readings (both km and miles)
- [ ] Different temperature scenarios

**2.2 Ground Truth Labeling**
- [ ] Expert manual labeling of each test image
- [ ] Document actual fuel level, odometer reading, temperatures
- [ ] Note gauge types and scale markings
- [ ] Record any ambiguous cases

**2.3 Accuracy Measurement**
- [ ] Test each image through vision system
- [ ] Compare extracted data to ground truth
- [ ] Calculate accuracy rates by field type:
  - Odometer reading accuracy
  - Fuel level accuracy (by scale type)
  - Temperature reading accuracy
  - Warning light detection accuracy
- [ ] Document failure modes and edge cases

### **Phase 3: Confidence Score Calibration (Week 3-4)**

**3.1 Empirical Confidence Mapping**
- [ ] Replace placeholder confidence scores with measured accuracy
- [ ] Map confidence scores to actual accuracy rates
- [ ] Validate confidence scores predict real accuracy

**3.2 Confidence Score Validation**
- [ ] Ensure individual scores sum to reasonable overall score
- [ ] Test confidence calculation with various input combinations
- [ ] Verify no mathematical contradictions

## üéØ **Production Readiness Criteria**

**Must Have Before Production:**
1. ‚úÖ Confidence bug completely fixed and tested
2. ‚úÖ 90%+ accuracy on 20+ diverse test images
3. ‚úÖ Empirically calibrated confidence scores
4. ‚úÖ Documented failure modes and edge cases
5. ‚úÖ Root cause understanding of all fixes

**Nice to Have:**
- A/B testing framework for ongoing validation
- Automated regression testing
- Performance benchmarks

## üìä **Current Test Results**

**Images Tested:** 1 (insufficient)
**Accuracy Measured:** Unknown (no ground truth comparison)
**Confidence System:** Broken (mathematical contradictions)
**Root Cause Understanding:** Incomplete

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deployment Recommendation**

**Current Status:** **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

**Reasons:**
- Fundamental reliability issues (confidence bug)
- Insufficient testing (single image)
- No empirical accuracy baseline
- Unproven system behavior

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix confidence calculation bug
2. Execute systematic testing plan
3. Measure real accuracy rates
4. Only then consider production deployment

## üî¨ **Testing Methodology**

**Controlled Variables:**
- Same prompt version for all tests
- Same model (GPT-4o) and parameters
- Consistent image preprocessing

**Measured Variables:**
- Extraction accuracy by field type
- Confidence score accuracy
- Processing time and reliability
- Failure modes and edge cases

**Success Criteria:**
- 90%+ accuracy on diverse test set
- Confidence scores correlate with actual accuracy
- No mathematical contradictions in validation
- Documented and understood system behavior
