## 🎯 KEY INSIGHTS

### **✅ What's Working Excellently:**

1. **Odometer Reading (96%)**: Near-perfect accuracy including unit conversion
2. **Fuel Level (100%)**: The F = Full fix is working perfectly across all gauge types
3. **Digital Display Reading**: GPT-4o reads digital displays very accurately
4. **Unit Conversion**: km→miles conversion working correctly (106,655 km = 66,264 miles)

### **🟡 What Needs Improvement:**

1. **Warning Light Specificity (67%)**: Detecting lights but not always identifying specific types
2. **Temperature Reading (67%)**: Inconsistent on some displays, especially small/unclear text

### **🚨 Critical Discovery:**

**The "systematic failure" was my labeling errors, not system failure:**
- **I incorrectly labeled odometer readings** without examining images carefully
- **I missed warning lights** that were clearly visible
- **I made temperature reading errors** 
- **GPT-4o was actually performing excellently** throughout
