    "result": "`npm test features/to` (and with `--`) exited non-zero immediately, and the sandbox didn’t capture any stdout/stderr to share. I checked the repo and there isn’t a path under `features/` that begins with `to` (existing ones are `auth`, `capture`, `chat`, `events`, `insights`, `migrations`, `timeline`, `vehicles`, `vision`). Please double-check the intended test target and re-run with the correct path, e.g. `npm test -- features/timeline`.\n",
