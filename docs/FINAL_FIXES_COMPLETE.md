    <DollarSign className="w-5 h-5 text-green-600" />
  </div>
  
  {/* Content */}
  <Stack spacing="xs">
    <Flex align="center" gap="xs">
      <Text className="font-semibold">{cost}</Text>
      {aiGenerated && <AIBadgeWithPopover />}
    </Flex>
    <Text>{date} • {vendor}</Text>
    <Text className="text-xs">{gallons} gal • {mpg} MPG</Text>
  </Stack>
  
  {/* Arrow */}
