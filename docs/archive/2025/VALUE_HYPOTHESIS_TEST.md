# Value Hypothesis Validation - Before Workflow Development

## Core Hypothesis to Test
**"Automated document processing for vehicle maintenance creates enough utility to justify user effort"**

## Critical Assumptions to Validate

### 1. Time Savings Assumption
**Test**: Compare manual vs automated entry time
- Manual: User enters service data from receipt (vendor, date, amount, service type)
- Automated: User uploads receipt, reviews/corrects extracted data, saves
- **Measure**: Actual time difference, error rates, user preference

### 2. Cognitive Load Assumption  
**Test**: Does 75% accuracy help or hurt?
- Scenario A: User starts with blank form
- Scenario B: User starts with 75% accurate pre-filled form
- **Measure**: Time to completion, mental effort rating, error rates

### 3. Actionable Value Assumption
**Test**: Do insights drive behavior?
- Show user their service history/patterns/costs
- Ask: "What would you do differently based on this information?"
- **Measure**: Concrete actions they'd take, willingness to pay for insights

### 4. Problem Existence Assumption
**Test**: Is vehicle tracking actually a pain point?
- Interview: "How do you currently track vehicle maintenance?"
- Follow-up: "What's frustrating about your current approach?"
- **Measure**: Pain level (1-10), current solutions, workarounds

## Minimal Validation Tests (Single Person, No Users)

### Self-Testing Approach
1. **Personal Use Case**: Track your own vehicle maintenance for 2 weeks
   - Week 1: Manual spreadsheet tracking
   - Week 2: Current vision system + manual review
   - Compare: time, accuracy, insights generated

2. **Proxy Testing**: Ask 3-5 friends/family to try both approaches
   - Give them sample receipts
   - Time both manual and automated entry
   - Get honest feedback on preference and why

3. **Value Proposition Clarity**: Can you explain the benefit in one sentence?
   - "This saves you X minutes per receipt"
   - "This helps you Y by showing Z patterns"
   - If you can't articulate clear value, users won't see it either

## Success/Failure Criteria

### Value Hypothesis VALIDATED if:
- Automated processing saves >50% time vs manual
- Users prefer pre-filled forms even with 25% error rate
- Users can identify 2+ actionable insights from their data
- Users rate current tracking methods as 6+ pain level

### Value Hypothesis FAILED if:
- Manual entry is faster or equally fast
- Users prefer starting with blank forms
- Generated insights are "interesting but not actionable"
- Users rate current tracking as <4 pain level (not a real problem)

## Resource Allocation Decision Tree

### If Value Hypothesis VALIDATED:
- **Then**: Invest in workflow optimization
- **Focus**: User experience for proven value
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks on UX development

### If Value Hypothesis FAILED:
- **Then**: Pivot or abandon vehicle tracking focus
- **Options**: Different use case, different market, different approach
- **Timeline**: 1 week to identify alternative direction

## Key Insight
**Building excellent workflows for unproven value is the most expensive mistake in product development.**

Test the core value proposition with minimal UX first. If people don't want the basic utility, they won't want the polished version either.

**Next Action**: Spend 2-3 days validating core value hypothesis before any workflow development.
