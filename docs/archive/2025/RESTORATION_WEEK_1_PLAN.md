# 📅 WEEK 1 RESTORATION EXECUTION PLAN

**Start Date:** 2025-09-29  
**Goal:** Restore critical vehicle and event management functionality  
**Success Criteria:** Users can create vehicles and log events with vision integration

## 🎯 DAY-BY-DAY EXECUTION

### **Day 1 (Today): Dependency Resolution & Planning**
**Status:** ✅ IN PROGRESS

#### **Completed:**
- ✅ SWR dependency fixed (invalid version → 2.2.4)
- ✅ Dependency audit completed
- ✅ Restoration plan created with clear timelines
- ✅ Integration testing strategy defined

#### **Next Steps:**
- [ ] Create missing utility files (lib/utils/errors.ts validation)
- [ ] Fix import path standardization
- [ ] Create dependency validation script

### **Day 2: Core Utility Infrastructure**
**Target:** Fix all import paths and create missing utilities

#### **Tasks:**
```bash
# 1. Validate all lib/utils/* files exist and compile
# 2. Fix lib/domain/types.ts completeness  
# 3. Create lib/middleware/tenant-context.ts if missing
# 4. Standardize import paths across codebase
# 5. Test utility imports in isolation
```

#### **Success Criteria:**
- All utility modules import without errors
- Domain types compile successfully
- Middleware functions available for endpoints

### **Day 3-4: Vehicle Management Restoration**
**Target:** Restore full vehicle CRUD functionality

#### **Priority Endpoints:**
```
pages/api/vehicles/
├── index.ts          - List/create vehicles
├── [id].ts          - Get/update/delete vehicle  
├── onboard.ts       - Vehicle onboarding flow
└── [id]/images.ts   - Vehicle image management
```

#### **Restoration Steps:**
1. **Fix Import Dependencies**
   ```typescript
   // Ensure these imports work:
   import { handleApiError, ValidationError } from '../../lib/utils/errors'
   import { listEnvelope, trackEnvelopeUsage } from '../../lib/utils/http-envelope'
   import { getVehicleDisplayName } from '../../lib/domain/types'
   ```

2. **Test Vehicle Operations**
   ```bash
   # Test each endpoint independently:
   curl -X GET /api/vehicles
   curl -X POST /api/vehicles -d '{"make":"Toyota","model":"Camry"}'
   curl -X GET /api/vehicles/[id]
   ```

3. **Integration Testing**
   ```typescript
   // Test vision system can access vehicle data:
   - Document processing → vehicle association
   - Service records → vehicle history
   - Odometer readings → vehicle mileage updates
   ```

### **Day 5-7: Event Management Restoration**
**Target:** Restore event logging and retrieval

#### **Priority Endpoints:**
```
pages/api/events/
├── save.ts          - Create events (maintenance, fuel, etc.)
├── [id].ts         - Get/update/delete events
└── timeline.ts     - Event timeline for vehicles
```

#### **Critical Integration Points:**
```typescript
// Vision system → Event creation flow:
1. Document processed by vision system
2. Structured data extracted (service, fuel, odometer)
3. Event created via /api/events/save
4. Event associated with vehicle
5. Timeline updated for user display
```

#### **Validation Requirements:**
- Events can be created manually via API
- Vision system can create events automatically
- Events display correctly in vehicle timelines
- Event data integrates with document processing results

## 🧪 INTEGRATION TESTING CHECKPOINTS

### **After Vehicle Restoration (Day 4):**
```bash
# Test Checklist:
[ ] Vehicle CRUD operations work
[ ] Vehicle onboarding flow functional
[ ] Vehicle images can be uploaded/managed
[ ] Vision system can access vehicle data
[ ] No performance degradation in vision processing
```

### **After Event Restoration (Day 7):**
```bash
# Test Checklist:
[ ] Events can be created/retrieved
[ ] Vision processing creates events automatically
[ ] Events associate correctly with vehicles
[ ] Timeline displays work properly
[ ] End-to-end document processing → event creation works
```

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### **Daily Build Validation:**
```bash
# Run after each endpoint restoration:
npm run build
npm run test
npm run lint

# If build fails:
1. Immediately identify and fix issue
2. Do not proceed to next endpoint
3. Document issue and resolution
```

### **Rollback Plan:**
```bash
# If restoration causes issues:
1. Move problematic endpoint back to deployment-temp-disabled/
2. Restore previous working state
3. Analyze issue in isolation
4. Fix and retry with proper testing
```

### **Performance Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor vision system performance:
- API response times should remain <5s
- Error rates should stay <1%
- Cost optimization should maintain 40-60% savings
- No memory leaks or resource issues
```

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

### **Functional Targets:**
- **Vehicle Management:** 100% CRUD operations working
- **Event Management:** 100% logging and retrieval working  
- **Vision Integration:** Document processing creates events automatically
- **User Experience:** Complete onboarding → document processing → event logging flow

### **Technical Targets:**
- **Build Success:** Clean compilation with all restored endpoints
- **Test Coverage:** >80% for restored functionality
- **Performance:** No degradation in vision system speed
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation maintained

## 🎯 WEEK 1 DELIVERABLES

### **End of Week 1:**
- ✅ **Core Platform Functional:** Users can create vehicles and log events
- ✅ **Vision Integration Working:** Document processing creates events automatically
- ✅ **Quality Maintained:** Clean builds, proper testing, no performance issues
- ✅ **Documentation Updated:** Clear status of what's working vs. still disabled

### **Preparation for Week 2:**
