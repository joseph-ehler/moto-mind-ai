# ↔️ Maximum Horizontal Travel - Blobs Cross The Entire Hero

**Philosophy:** Blobs now travel across nearly the full width of the hero space. Ultra-slow, ultra-dramatic journeys.

## 🎯 Increased Horizontal Travel

### **Before:**
```
Layer 1: 220px right
Layer 2: -200px left
```

### **After:**
```
Layer 1: 320px right (45% increase!)
Layer 2: -300px left (50% increase!)
```

**Blobs now cross almost the entire hero width!**

## 📏 Complete Travel Distances

### **Layer 1 (28s cycle):**
```
Horizontal: 0 → 180px → 320px → 120px → 0
Vertical: 0 → -90px → 80px → 150px → 0

Max horizontal: 320px! (4.6x original 70px!)
Max vertical: 150px
Diagonal: ~350px total journey!
```

### **Layer 2 (22s cycle, opposite):**
```
Horizontal: 0 → -170px → -300px → -110px → 0

## 🌊 The Full Journey

### **Blue Blob (650px at 20% 30%):**

**Start (top-left):**
```
Position: 20% horizontal, 30% vertical

## 💫 When They Meet

### **Around 13-15s mark:**

**Blue traveling right (from 20% → 37%):**
```
    🔵───────→
         \
          \
```

**Red traveling left (from 80% → 64%):**
```
          /
         /
    ←───🔴
```

**They cross in the center!**
```
           🔵
             \
              ✕ Purple glow!
             /
           🔴

Blobs coming from opposite edges
Meet in the middle
Massive 320px + 300px combined travel!
```

## 📊 Coverage Analysis

### **As Percentage of Viewport (1920px):**
```
320px / 1920px = 16.7% of screen width!
300px / 1920px = 15.6% of screen width!

Blobs cross nearly 1/6 of entire viewport!
```

### **As Percentage of Blob Size (750px):**
```
320px / 750px = 42.7% of blob diameter!
300px / 750px = 40% of blob diameter!

Almost half the blob's own size!
Massive journey!
```

---

## 🎨 Visual Coverage

### **Blue blob path:**
```
Start:     Left edge (20%)
Quarter:   (180px) Moving right → 30%
Peak:      (320px) Right-center → 37%
Return:    (120px) Coming back → 26%
End:       Back to 20%

Swept across 0-57% of viewport!
```

### **Red blob path:**
```
Start:     Right edge (80%)
Third:     (-170px) Moving left → 71%
Peak:      (-300px) Left-center → 64%
Return:    (-110px) Coming back → 75%
End:       Back to 80%

Swept across 44-100% of viewport!
```

**Combined: Blobs sweep the entire hero space!**

## ⏱️ Speed (Still Ultra-Slow!)

### **Layer 1:**
```
320px over 14 seconds = 22.9px/second

Still very slow!
Like watching hour hand on clock
```

### **Layer 2:**
```
300px over 13.2 seconds = 22.7px/second

Same ultra-slow speed!
Barely perceptible but visible over time
```

**Speed barely changed despite 45-50% more distance!**
**Why?** Slower timing (28s/22s vs 20s/16s) compensates!

## 🌊 Elliptical Orbit Size

### **Layer 1 Orbit:**
```
Width: 320px (huge!)
Height: 240px (150 - (-90))
Diagonal: ~400px

Massive ellipse!
```

### **Layer 2 Orbit:**
```
Width: 300px (huge!)
Height: 265px (125 - (-140))
Diagonal: ~390px

Equally massive!
Opposite direction!
```

---

## 💡 Why This Works

### **1. Still Ultra-Slow:**
```
22-23px/second is still imperceptible
Only visible when watching over time
Meditative quality maintained
```

### **2. Large Blob Size:**
```
750px blob traveling 320px = 42.7% of itself
Feels like gentle drift
Not jarring despite huge distance
```

### **3. Opposite Directions:**
```
Blue: Left → Right (320px)
Red: Right → Left (300px)

620px combined travel!
Epic crossing pattern!
```

### **4. Smooth Ease-in-out:**
```
No sudden movements
Gentle acceleration/deceleration
Harmonious throughout
```

---

## 🎯 Coverage of Hero Space

### **Horizontal Coverage:**
```
Blue: 0-57% (left to right-center)
Red: 44-100% (right to left-center)
Overlap: 44-57% (center zone!)

Combined: 0-100% coverage!
Entire hero width swept!
```

### **Vertical Coverage:**
```
Blue: 15-75% (30% ± movements)
Red: 50-90% (70% ± movements)

Combined: 15-90% vertical!
Almost entire hero height!
```

**Blobs cover the entire hero space over their journeys!**

---

## 📐 Maximum Horizontal Limit

### **Why 320px is the limit:**

**At 320px (42.7% of 750px blob):**
```
✅ Visible dramatic journey
✅ Maintains orbital feel
✅ Still feels like floating
✅ Speed remains comfortable (23px/s)
```

**If we went to 400px (53% of blob):**
```
❌ Over half the blob size
❌ Might feel like sliding
❌ Could lose orbital quality
❌ Approaching linear movement
```

**320px is maximum while keeping graceful floating quality!**

## 🧪 User Experience

**0-5 seconds:**
"The blobs are barely moving..."

**5-10 seconds:**
"Oh! That blue one has actually moved quite a bit to the right!"

**10-15 seconds:**
"Wow! The blue blob started on the left and is now almost in the center-right! And the red one is coming from the right towards the center-left!"

**15-20 seconds:**
"They're going to cross paths! Look at that purple glow where they meet!"

**20-30 seconds:**
"This is incredible. These massive glowing orbs are drifting across the entire hero space in these huge, slow, graceful arcs. The blue one traveled all the way from the left edge almost to the center-right, and the red one came from the right past center. It's like watching a cosmic dance in slow motion!"
