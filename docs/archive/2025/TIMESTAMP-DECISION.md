# TIMESTAMP FIELD DECISION: `created_at` vs `captured_at`

## 🎯 THE ISSUE
Mock data was using `captured_at` but the actual schema uses `created_at`, causing SQL errors:
```
ERROR: 42703: column "captured_at" of relation "vehicle_events" does not exist
```

## 📊 FIELD ANALYSIS

### **Current Schema Reality:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.vehicle_events (
  id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT extensions.uuid_generate_v4(),
  date DATE NOT NULL,                    -- Event date (from document)
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),  -- Record creation time
  -- other fields...
)
```

### **Available Timestamp Fields:**

| Field | Type | Purpose | Value | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|---------|-------|------|------|
| `date` | DATE | When event occurred | From document (e.g., "2025-09-25") | ✅ Historical accuracy | ❌ No time component |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | When record created | Auto-generated by DB | ✅ Always present<br>✅ Precise timestamp<br>✅ Good for timeline ordering | ❌ Not when user captured |
| `captured_at` | N/A | When user captured | Would need to be added | ✅ User-centric timing | ❌ Doesn't exist<br>❌ Requires schema change |

## 🎯 DECISION: USE `created_at`

### **Why `created_at` is the Right Choice:**

1. **✅ EXISTS** - No schema changes needed, works immediately
2. **✅ AUTOMATIC** - Database populates it automatically on INSERT
3. **✅ CONSISTENT** - Always has a value, never null
4. **✅ TIMELINE ORDERING** - Perfect for "when did I add this" chronological display
5. **✅ USER EXPERIENCE** - Shows recency of capture activity
6. **✅ PRODUCTION READY** - No migration risk

### **Real-World Usage:**
- **Timeline Display:** "2 days ago", "1 week ago", "3 weeks ago"
- **Sorting:** Most recently added events appear first
- **User Context:** "When did I log this event?"
- **Activity Tracking:** Shows user engagement patterns

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES MADE

### **1. Fixed Mock Data:**
```sql
-- BEFORE (broken):
INSERT INTO vehicle_events (id, vehicle_id, type, captured_at, ...)

-- AFTER (working):
INSERT INTO vehicle_events (id, vehicle_id, type, date, ...)
-- created_at is auto-populated by DEFAULT now()
```

### **2. Updated TypeScript Interface:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
interface TimelineEvent {
  captured_at: string
}

// AFTER:
interface TimelineEvent {
  created_at: string  // Matches actual schema
}
```

### **3. Updated Component References:**
```typescript
// All references changed from:
event.captured_at

// To:
event.created_at
```

## 📈 BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH

### **User Experience:**
- **Timeline shows capture recency** - "I added this repair 2 days ago"
- **Chronological ordering** - Most recent captures appear first
- **Activity tracking** - See when you've been logging events

### **Technical Benefits:**
- **No schema migration** - Works with existing database
- **Automatic population** - No client-side timestamp management
- **Consistent data** - Database ensures all records have timestamps
- **Production safe** - No breaking changes

### **Business Value:**
- **User engagement metrics** - Track when users log events
- **Data freshness** - Know how recently information was captured
- **Timeline accuracy** - Events ordered by when they were added to system

## 🎨 TIMELINE DISPLAY EXAMPLE

```
Vehicle Timeline - 2021 Honda Accord                    8 events

────────── RECENT (LAST 7 DAYS) • 4 ──────────

🔧  Alternator replacement                      
    Joe's Auto Repair • $685 • Warranty: 12 months
    At 87,450 mi • Emergency repair           2 days ago [View] ⌄ ✕

✅  Safety inspection passed                    
    Certificate #SI-2025-789456 • Valid until Dec 2025
    At 87,100 mi • Next due Dec 2025          1 week ago [View] ⌄ ✕
```

**The "2 days ago" and "1 week ago" timestamps come from `created_at` - showing when the user captured/logged these events.**

## ✅ CONCLUSION

**`created_at` is the optimal choice because:**
- ✅ **Works immediately** with existing schema
- ✅ **Provides user-centric timeline** ordering
- ✅ **Requires zero migration risk**
- ✅ **Delivers excellent UX** for timeline display

**The mock data and UI components are now fully aligned with the production schema and ready for testing!**
