# 🤖 Chatbot Context & Data Access Fix

## Problem Identified
The chatbot couldn't see events older than 12 months, causing it to miss historical data when users asked about past events.

**User Issue:**
```
User: "can you find me my fuel ups in NV? from 5 years ago or so?"
Bot: "It seems I don't have access to any fuel-up records specifically 
      from Nevada or from around five years ago..."
```

**But the data EXISTS!** The timeline shows:
```
July 2020 Fuel Fill-Up at Fuel Depot in Jean, NV
$98.55 • 33.18 gal × $2.97/gal
1 Goodsprings Rd, Jean, NV 89019
```

---

## Root Cause

### **Vehicle Context Builder Limited Time Range**
`/lib/ai/vehicle-context-builder.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
eventLimit = 10          // Only 10 events
dateRangeMonths = 12     // Only last 12 months
.gte('date', dateFrom)   // Filter: events >= 12 months ago
```

**Result:** The July 2020 event (5 years old) was **outside the 12-month window**.

---

## ✅ Solution

### **1. Increased Event Limit (10 → 50)**
```typescript
eventLimit = 50  // Can see up to 50 events instead of 10
```

### **2. Added `includeAllEvents` Option**
```typescript
interface BuildContextOptions {
  includeAllEvents?: boolean // New: Include all events regardless of date
}
```

### **3. Default to Full History**
```typescript
includeAllEvents = true // Default to true - AI should see full history
```

### **4. Dynamic Date Range**
```typescript
const dateFrom = new Date()
if (!includeAllEvents) {
  dateFrom.setMonth(dateFrom.getMonth() - dateRangeMonths)
} else {
  // Go back 100 years to get all events
  dateFrom.setFullYear(dateFrom.getFullYear() - 100)
}
```

### **5. Enhanced Event Data**
**Added location & fuel details:**
```typescript
interface {
  location?: string   // Geocoded address (e.g., "Jean, NV")
  gallons?: number    // For fuel events
}
```

### **6. Better Formatting for AI**
**Before:**
```
- 7/9/2020 @ 90,000 mi ($98.55) - Fuel Depot - fuel
```

**After:**
```
- 7/9/2020 @ 90,000 mi ($98.55) 33.18 gal - Fuel Depot in 1 Goodsprings Rd, Jean, NV 89019 - fuel
```
