## 💎 ELITE-TIER FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### **1. Progressive Enhancement (5 Levels):**
```
Level 1: Basic Data
- Raw event/station/cost data

Level 2: Aggregations
- Visit counts, totals, sums

Level 3: Analytics
- Price trends, spending patterns, averages

Level 4: Insights
- Patterns, comparisons, anomalies
- "You visit this station weekly"
- "Prices are increasing +5%"
- "Spending is trending up"

Level 5: Predictions
- Future cost predictions
- Maintenance forecasts
- Activity patterns
```

### **2. Contextual Intelligence:**
```
Every Response Includes:
✅ Primary data (what you asked for)
✅ Meta context (pagination, filters)
✅ Insights (actionable intelligence)
✅ Trends (patterns over time)
✅ Comparisons (vs averages, vs previous)

Example Station Response:
{
  data: { station, stats, events, patterns },
  meta: { total, date_range },
  insights: [
    "You visit weekly (every 7 days)",
    "Prices increasing +5%",
    "This is one of your regular stations"
  ]
}
```

### **3. Smart Defaults:**
```
✅ Stations sorted by visit count (most visited first)
✅ Timeline defaults to last 30 days (most relevant)
✅ Costs default to current month
✅ Favorites prioritized in lists
✅ Nearby uses intelligent geospatial filtering
```

### **4. Multi-Dimensional Analysis:**
```
Cost Analysis:
- By category (fuel, maintenance, etc.)
- By vehicle
- By time period (month, year)
- By trend (increasing/decreasing)
- With predictions (next month, quarter, year)

Timeline Analysis:
- Chronological (what happened when)
- Grouped (patterns by type/month/location)
- Summary (statistical overview)

Station Analysis:
- By visit frequency
- By price trends
- By location (nearby)
- By loyalty (favorites)
```
