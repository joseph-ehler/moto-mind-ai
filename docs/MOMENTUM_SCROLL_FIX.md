# ✅ Momentum Scroll Fixed - Event Details Section

**Issue:** Event Details cards were wrapped in regular `Stack` preventing momentum scroll

**Status:** 🟢 **FIXED**

---

## 🐛 The Problem

Event Details section was using:
```tsx
<Stack spacing="md">
  <DataSectionV2 title="💵 Payment Breakdown" />
  <DataSectionV2 title="📍 Location & Time" />
  <DataSectionV2 title="🧾 Transaction Details" />
  <DataSectionV2 title="🚗 Vehicle & Notes" />
</Stack>
```

**Issue:** Regular `Stack` has static spacing - no momentum effect!

---

## ✅ The Fix

Changed to:
```tsx
<MomentumStack baseSpacing="md">
  <DataSectionV2 title="💵 Payment Breakdown" />
  <DataSectionV2 title="📍 Location & Time" />
  <DataSectionV2 title="🧾 Transaction Details" />
  <DataSectionV2 title="🚗 Vehicle & Notes" />
</MomentumStack>
```

**Result:** Cards now have momentum scroll effect! ⚡

## 🎨 What is Momentum Scroll?

### **MomentumStack:**
- Detects scroll velocity
- Adjusts gap between cards dynamically
- **Fast scroll** = larger gaps (cards spread apart)
- **Slow scroll** = normal gaps (cards close together)
- Smooth transition (0.15s ease)

### **Visual Effect:**
```
Slow scroll:
[Card]
  ↕ 16px
[Card]
  ↕ 16px  
[Card]

Fast scroll:
[Card]
  ↕
  ↕ 32px+ (expands!)
  ↕
[Card]
  ↕
  ↕ 32px+
  ↕
[Card]
```

**Result:** Feels fluid and responsive! 🌊

## 🧪 Test It

**After refresh:**
1. Scroll slowly through Event Details cards
   - ✅ Normal spacing (16px)
2. Scroll quickly through cards
   - ✅ Gaps expand dynamically!
   - ✅ Smooth transition
3. Stop scrolling
   - ✅ Gaps return to normal

**Momentum effect active!** ⚡

## 📝 Changes Made

**File:** `/app/(authenticated)/events/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changed:**
1. `Stack spacing="md"` → `MomentumStack baseSpacing="md"`
2. Closing tag `</Stack>` → `</MomentumStack>`
3. Removed conflicting wrapper `space-y-4` class

**Result:** Cards have proper momentum scroll behavior! 🎯

---

## 💡 Why baseSpacing?

**MomentumStack props:**
- `baseSpacing` (not `spacing`) - Base gap amount
- `children` - Card components
- `className` - Optional styling

**Values:** `xs | sm | md | lg | xl | 2xl`

**Our choice:** `md` = 16px base gap

## ✅ Fixed!

**Event Details section now:**
- ✅ Has momentum scroll effect
- ✅ Gaps expand/contract with velocity
- ✅ Smooth, fluid transitions
- ✅ Professional feel

**Scroll through those cards and feel the momentum!** 🚀✨
