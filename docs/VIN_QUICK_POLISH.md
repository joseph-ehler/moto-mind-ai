Applied 3 critical refinements before shipping:

---

## ✨ **REFINEMENTS APPLIED**

### **1. Cleaned Up Display Names** ✅

**Before:**
```
"2022 CHRYSLER 300 Touring L LX Not Applicable Sedan/Saloon"
"2013 CHEVROLET Captiva Sport LTZ Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV)/Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV)"
```

**After:**
```
"2022 Chrysler 300 Touring L Sedan"
"2013 Chevrolet Captiva Sport LTZ SUV/MPV"
```

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Title-cased make names ("FORD" → "Ford")
- ✅ Removed "Not Applicable" text
- ✅ Cleaned redundant body type descriptions
- ✅ Simplified compound categories
- ✅ Removed duplicate info (trim + body type)

**Code:**
- `lib/vin/decoder.ts` - Updated `buildDisplayName()` + `titleCase()`

---

### **2. Added Share Report Button** ✅

**Feature:**
- 📤 "Share This Report" button (secondary variant, full width)
- ✅ Native share API on mobile (iOS/Android)

**Why This Matters:**

- Mobile users get native share (SMS, WhatsApp, Twitter, etc.)
- Desktop users can copy/paste anywhere
- Formatted text looks good everywhere
- FREE marketing in every share!

**Code:**
- `app/(app)/onboarding/confirm/page.tsx` - Added `handleShare()` + button

---

### **3. Added Safety Feature Clarity** ✅

**Before:**
```
○ ABS
○ Traction Control
✓ Blind Spot Warning
```

**After:**
```
○ ABS (not equipped)
○ Traction Control (not equipped)
✓ Blind Spot Warning
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Users know `○` means "not equipped" (not "unknown" or "error")
- Clear communication = trust
- Helps users understand their vehicle's actual features
- Useful for insurance quotes, resale value, comparisons

**Code:**
- `app/(app)/onboarding/confirm/page.tsx` - Updated `renderSafetyFeature()`

```
