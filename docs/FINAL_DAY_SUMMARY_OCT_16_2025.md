   - Clear ownership (event belongs to vehicle)
   - Permission checks simplified
   - RESTful hierarchy

✅ Flat for Direct Access:
   GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/events/[id]
   - Fast when you have ID
   - No need for parent
   - Standard REST

✅ Actions as Sub-Resources:
   POST /api/events/[id]/geocode
   POST /api/events/[id]/restore
   - Operations beyond CRUD
   - External integrations
   - Computed data

✅ Standard HTTP Methods:
   GET = Read
   POST = Create
   PATCH = Partial Update
   DELETE = Remove
   
   NO MORE:
   ❌ /save endpoints
