# 🚀 Week 1: Minimal Viable Architecture

**Philosophy:** Prove value before big investment  
**Approach:** 10% tools, 90% discipline  
**Status:** Ready to use  
**Time to build:** 2 hours  
**Time to implement:** 1-2 hours this week  

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE BUILT

### **1. Manual Migration Guide** ✅
**File:** `docs/FEATURE-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md`

**Purpose:** Step-by-step instructions for migrating ONE feature manually

**What it teaches:**
- The feature-first pattern
- Where each type of code belongs (domain, data, ui, hooks, tests)
- How to update imports
- How to test after migration
- Strangler fig pattern (old and new coexist)

**Time:** ~1.5 hours to migrate one feature

---

### **2. Migration Helper Script** ✅
**File:** `scripts/migrate-feature.ts`  
**Command:** `npm run migrate:feature <feature-name>`

**Purpose:** Semi-automated assistant (human stays in control)

**What it does:**
- Creates feature directory structure
- Discovers files that might belong to feature
- Suggests where each file should go
- Asks for confirmation before moving
- Updates imports automatically
- Runs tests to verify

**What it DOESN'T do:**
- Doesn't move files without asking
- Doesn't assume it knows better
- Doesn't break things silently

**Example usage:**
```bash
npm run migrate:feature vehicles

# Output:
🔄 FEATURE MIGRATION HELPER
Mode: Semi-Automated (human confirms each step)

📁 Step 1: Creating feature directory structure...
   ✅ Created domain/
   ✅ Created data/
   ✅ Created ui/
   ✅ Created hooks/
   ✅ Created __tests__/

🔍 Step 2: Discovering files...
📁 Found 15 files that might belong to vehicles

📦 Step 3: Review and move files
For each file: y=yes, n=no, e=edit, q=quit

[1/15] lib/domain/vehicles/types.ts
   → features/vehicles/domain/types.ts
   Category: domain | Confidence: high
   Reason: Domain logic
   Move? (y/n/e/q): y
   ✅ Moved

[2/15] lib/services/vehicles/api.ts
   → features/vehicles/data/api.ts
   Category: data | Confidence: high
   Reason: Data/API layer
   Move? (y/n/e/q): y
   ✅ Moved

...

🔧 Step 4: Updating imports...
   🔄 Updating imports across codebase...
   ✅ Updated imports in 23 files

🧪 Step 5: Running tests...
   Running type check...
   ✅ Type check passed
   Running tests...
   ✅ Tests passed

✅ MIGRATION COMPLETE
```

**Time:** Reduces 1.5 hour manual process to ~30 minutes

---

### **3. Architecture Validator** ✅
**File:** `scripts/validate-architecture.ts`  
**Commands:**
- `npm run arch:validate` - Check entire codebase
- `npm run arch:validate:staged` - Check staged files only (pre-commit)

**Purpose:** Detect architectural violations (WARNING MODE only)

**What it checks:**
1. Feature-specific code in lib/ or components/
2. Deep imports (`../../../`)
3. New files without tests
4. Incomplete feature structures

**Mode: WARNING ONLY**
- Detects violations
- Shows helpful messages
- Does NOT block commits
- Helps you learn the pattern

**Example output:**
```bash
npm run arch:validate

🏛️  ARCHITECTURE VALIDATOR
Mode: WARNING ONLY (Week 1)

📁 Checking 45 files...

⚠️  WARNINGS:

   lib/services/vehicles/api.ts
   Issue: Feature-specific code found in lib/
   💡 Consider moving to features/vehicles/data/

   components/vehicle/VehicleCard.tsx
   Issue: Feature-specific code found in components/
   💡 Consider moving to features/vehicles/ui/

   app/vehicles/page.tsx
   Issue: Found 2 deep import(s): ../../../
   💡 Use @/ path aliases instead: import { X } from "@/features/..."

💡 INFO:

   features/capture/
   Issue: Incomplete feature structure
   💡 Missing or empty: __tests__

Total: 4 issue(s) found

🔧 Migrate a feature: npm run migrate:feature <name>

⚠️  Note: These are WARNINGS only (Week 1)
   Your commit will proceed.
   Use these to learn the patterns.
```

**Integration:** Already added to pre-commit hook (warning mode)

---

## 📋 WHAT TO DO THIS WEEK

### **Day 1: Read and Understand (30 min)**

1. **Read the migration guide:**
   ```bash
   cat docs/FEATURE-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md
   ```

2. **Understand the pattern:**
   - Feature-first architecture
   - Domain, data, ui, hooks, tests
   - Strangler fig (old and new coexist)

3. **Check current violations:**
   ```bash
   npm run arch:validate
   ```

---

### **Day 2-3: Migrate ONE Feature (2 hours)**

**Choose your best feature** (I recommend `vehicles`):

**Option A: Fully Manual (learn by doing)**
```bash
# Follow the guide step-by-step
cat docs/FEATURE-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md

# Create structure
mkdir -p features/vehicles/{domain,data,ui,hooks,__tests__}

# Move files manually
git mv lib/domain/vehicles/types.ts features/vehicles/domain/
git mv lib/services/vehicles/api.ts features/vehicles/data/
# ... etc

# Update imports
# Use VS Code find/replace

# Test
npm test features/vehicles

# Commit
git commit -m "feat(arch): migrate vehicles to feature-first"
```

**Option B: Semi-Automated (faster)**
```bash
# Use the helper script
npm run migrate:feature vehicles

# Follow the prompts
# It will ask you to confirm each step

# Test and commit when done
```

**Why start with vehicles?**
- Well-defined feature
- Important to app
- Good representative example
- Not too big, not too small

---

### **Day 4-5: Document What You Learned (30 min)**

Create `features/vehicles/README.md`:

```markdown
# Vehicles Feature

Migrated to feature-first architecture on [date]

## Structure

- `domain/` - Types, entities, business logic
- `data/` - API calls, queries, mutations
- `ui/` - Components specific to vehicles
- `hooks/` - Vehicle-specific React hooks
- `__tests__/` - All vehicle tests

## What Worked

- [What went smoothly]
- [What was easy]

## What Was Hard

- [What was difficult]
- [What needs improvement]

## Time

- Actual time: X hours
- Estimate was: 1.5 hours
```

**Why document:**
- Learn from first migration
- Improve process for next feature
- Share knowledge with team

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

After Week 1, you should have:

- ✅ Read and understood the migration guide
- ✅ Migrated ONE feature (vehicles) to feature-first
- ✅ Old code still works (strangler fig)
- ✅ Tests pass
- ✅ Documented learnings
- ✅ Architecture validator runs on commits (warning mode)

**Proof of success:**
```bash
# This should exist and have content
tree features/vehicles

# This should pass
npm test features/vehicles

# This should show no new violations
npm run arch:validate:staged
```

---

## 📈 WHAT'S NEXT

### **Week 2-3: Migrate More Features (if validated)**

**If Week 1 went well:**
- Migrate 2-3 more features
- Use the helper script (now you know the pattern)
- Takes ~30-45 min per feature

**Good candidates:**
1. `capture` - Similar to vehicles
2. `dashboard` - Central feature
3. `documents` - Simpler, good practice

**Don't migrate:**
- Infrastructure (auth, database, cache) - stays in lib/
- Design system - stays in components/
- Generic utilities - stays in lib/utils/

---

### **Week 4: Refine Tools (if needed)**

**After 3-4 migrations, you'll know:**
- What actually hurts
- What automation you need
- What you don't need

**Then decide:**
- Build more tooling? (maybe)
- Tighten validation? (progressively)
- Add AI-assisted refactoring? (if valuable)
- Or just keep it simple? (probably)

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### **1. Start Small, Prove Value**

**Wrong:**
```
Build full Repository Architect (5 hours)
Build full Tech Debt Manager (3 hours)
Migrate everything at once (10 hours)
Total: 18 hours before seeing value
```

**Right:**
```
Build minimal tools (2 hours)
Migrate ONE feature (1.5 hours)
See if it works (immediate feedback)
Total: 3.5 hours to proof of concept
```

### **2. Human Stays in Control**

**Helper script is ASSISTIVE, not AUTOMATIC:**
- Suggests moves, asks confirmation
- Human decides what goes where
- Catches edge cases
- Builds understanding

**Why?** Because:
- AI doesn't know your code like you do
- Mistakes are expensive
- Learning happens through manual work
- Trust is earned

### **3. Strangler Fig > Big Bang**

**Old and new coexist:**
```
features/
  vehicles/     # NEW

lib/
  services/vehicles/  # OLD (maybe empty now, but still exists)
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero risk
- Always releasable
- Test gradually
- Rollback is easy

**Remove old when:**
- A few weeks of stability
- 100% sure nothing uses it
- `git grep "@/lib/services/vehicles"` returns empty

### **4. Progressive Enhancement**

**Week 1:** Warn about violations  
**Week 4:** Warn louder  
**Week 8:** Block new violations  
**Week 12:** Block all violations  

**Why?** Prevents rebellion, builds habits gradually

### **5. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**

**Might not need:**
- Complex debt scoring
- Automated full migration
- AI-assisted everything

**Architecture cleanup might solve 80% of pain**

**Build only what you actually need, when you need it**

---

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

### **Don't: Migrate Everything at Once**
```
❌ "Let's migrate all 30 features this weekend!"
```
**Why:** High risk, no testing, team paralyzed

**Instead:**
```
✅ "Let's migrate vehicles this week"
✅ "If that works, capture next week"
```

### **Don't: Block Commits Immediately**
```
❌ Pre-commit hook blocks all violations from Day 1
```
**Why:** Team revolt, frustration, workarounds

**Instead:**
```
✅ Warn only (Week 1)
✅ Progressively tighten (Weeks 4, 8, 12)
```

### **Don't: Build Complex Tools First**
```
❌ "Let's build a full scoring system!"
❌ "Let's build AI-assisted refactoring!"
```
**Why:** You don't know what you need yet

**Instead:**
```
✅ Manual migration first
✅ Automate pain points as discovered
✅ Build minimum useful tools
```

### **Don't: Assume AI Knows Best**
```
❌ "AI will automatically categorize everything!"
```
**Why:** AI doesn't know your domain, makes mistakes

**Instead:**
```
✅ AI suggests, human decides
✅ Build understanding through manual work
✅ Automate only boring, safe parts
```

## ✅ WEEK 1 CHECKLIST

Before ending Week 1, verify:

- [ ] Read `FEATURE-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Understand feature-first pattern
- [ ] Ran `npm run arch:validate` to see current state
- [ ] Migrated ONE feature (vehicles recommended)
- [ ] Tests pass after migration
- [ ] Documented learnings in `features/vehicles/README.md`
- [ ] Architecture validator runs on commits (warning mode)
- [ ] Team knows about the change
- [ ] Decided: Continue to Week 2? (yes/no/adjust)

---

## 🎯 DECISION POINT

**At end of Week 1, decide:**

### **Option A: Continue (if successful)**
```
✅ Migration went smoothly
✅ Pattern makes sense
✅ Team understands it
✅ Value is clear

→ Week 2-3: Migrate 2-3 more features
```

### **Option B: Adjust (if issues)**
```
⚠️  Migration was harder than expected
⚠️  Pattern needs refinement
⚠️  Team needs more training
⚠️  Tools need improvement

→ Week 2: Fix issues, try again
```

### **Option C: Pause (if wrong direction)**
```
❌ Pattern doesn't fit our codebase
❌ More trouble than it's worth
❌ Team doesn't like it

→ Keep old structure, learn from experiment
```

**All options are valid!**

The goal is learning, not forcing a pattern that doesn't fit.

---

## 💎 FINAL THOUGHTS

**This is an experiment.**

You're testing:
- Does feature-first architecture work for us?
- Does it make code easier to work with?
- Is the juice worth the squeeze?

**One week will tell you.**

If yes → Continue gradually  
If no → Learned something valuable  
If maybe → Adjust and retry  

**There's no failure here, only learning.**
