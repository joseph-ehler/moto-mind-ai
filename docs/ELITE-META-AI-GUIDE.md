## 📈 **The Learning Cycle**

```
1. START MIGRATION
   ↓
   npm run migrate:ai vision

2. WORK & COMMIT
   ↓
   git commit -m "feat: migrate vision (Phase 1)"
   → Progress tracked automatically

3. COMPLETE MIGRATION
   ↓
   npm run migrate:complete
   → Saves to history
   → Auto-runs pattern detection (if 3+ migrations)

4. SYSTEM LEARNS
   ↓
   - Detects patterns
   - Improves estimates
   - Updates guidance

5. NEXT MIGRATION
   ↓
   Uses improved estimates and patterns
   
→ REPEAT → System gets smarter
```

## 💎 **Key Features**

### **Graceful Degradation**
- AI fails? Falls back to templates
- No API key? Uses template mode
- Limited data? Flags low confidence
- Always works, always improves

### **Smart with Limited Data**
- Works with 1 migration (basic tracking)
- Pattern detection at 3+ migrations
- High confidence at 5+ per complexity
- Improves continuously

### **Cost Optimization**
- Template mode: **FREE**
- AI mode: **~$0.01 per migration**
- Learning: **FREE** (uses history data)
- Total cost for 10 migrations: **~$0.10**

### **Safety First**
- Never deletes files automatically
- Always asks before running commands
- Pre-commit validation
- Architecture checks
- Test requirements

---

## 🎓 **Usage Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: First Migration (Learning)**
```bash
# Use template mode first time
npm run migrate auth
# Work through checklist
git commit -m "test: add auth tests (Phase 1)"
git commit -m "feat: migrate auth components (Phase 2)"
git commit -m "feat: migrate auth domain (Phase 3)"
npm run migrate:complete
```

### **Pattern 2: With AI (After 1+ migrations)**
```bash
# Use AI mode when you have examples
npm run migrate:ai chat
# AI analyzes YOUR code patterns
# Predicts issues based on YOUR history
# Custom checklist for YOUR feature
```

### **Pattern 3: Batch Learning (After 5+ migrations)**
```bash
# System has enough data for strong patterns
npm run migrate:learn
# Review suggested estimate changes
# Apply improvements to analyzer
# Next migrations even more accurate
```

## 📊 **Data & Privacy**

### **What's Stored**
- Migration timing data
- Component counts
- Test counts
- Quality metrics
- Issues encountered (if you add them)

### **What's NOT Stored**
- Actual code content
- Secrets or API keys
- Personal information
- Business logic

### **Where It's Stored**
- `data/migration-history.json` - Local file
- `.migration-*.json` - Temporary analysis files
- `.windsurf-guidance.json` - Updated guidance

### **AI Data**
- Code samples sent to OpenAI API (GPT-4 Turbo/GPT-5)
- First 800 chars of 3-5 files max
- Types, hooks, components only
- No secrets, no full files

---

## 🔧 **Customization**

### **Adjust Complexity Heuristics**
Edit `scripts/analyze-feature-complexity.ts`:
```typescript
// After collecting data, update these based on migrate:improve output
if (componentCount < 30 && maxDepth <= 2) {
  complexityLevel = 'low'
  estimatedTime = '0.5-1 hour'  // Adjust based on YOUR data
}
```

### **Add Custom Issue Detection**
Edit `scripts/predict-migration-issues.ts`:
```typescript
// Add your custom patterns
if (analysis.featureName.includes('admin')) {
  predictions.push({
    issue: 'Admin features require auth checks',
    probability: 0.9,
    phase: 'components',
    mitigation: 'Add auth provider checks early'
  })
}
```

### **Customize Checklist Templates**
Edit `scripts/generate-adaptive-checklist.ts`:
```typescript
// Add your team's specific steps
customizations.push({
  phase: 2,
  position: 'after',
  anchor: 'Move Components',
  content: `
### Team-Specific Step
Your custom guidance here
  `
})
```

- **Breakeven:** 6-11 migrations
- **Current Status:** 4 migrations = ~2 hours saved already

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: AI analysis fails**
```
Error: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Set API key in .env.local
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Or use template mode
npm run migrate vision  # No --ai flag
```

---

### **Problem: Pattern detection says "need more data"**
```
Limited data (only 2 migrations)
```

**Solution:**
- Complete more migrations (need 3+ for patterns)
- System will automatically trigger at 3
- Manual run: `npm run migrate:learn`

---

### **Problem: Estimates seem off**
```
Estimated 1h, took 2h
```

**Solution:**
1. Complete 3+ migrations per complexity level
2. Run `npm run migrate:improve`
3. Review suggested changes
4. Update analyzer with improved estimates
5. System will use new estimates going forward

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **Tip 1: Start with Templates**
Don't use AI mode for first migration. Learn the pattern manually, then let AI enhance it.

### **Tip 2: Track Issues**
When you hit problems, note them. The system will learn and predict them next time.

### **Tip 3: Review Predictions**
AI predictions are probabilistic. Use judgment—don't blindly follow.

### **Tip 4: Iterate on Estimates**
After 5+ migrations, run `migrate:improve` and update the analyzer. System gets more accurate.

### **Tip 5: Customize for Your Team**
Add team-specific patterns to the checklist generator. Make it yours.
