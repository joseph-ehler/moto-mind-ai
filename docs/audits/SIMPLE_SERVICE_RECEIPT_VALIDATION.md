# Simple Service Receipt Validation - Week 1 Only

## Objective
Manually test current vision system accuracy on real service receipts to determine if the foundation justifies further investment.

## Concrete Action Plan

### Step 1: Source Real Documents (Day 1-2)
- **Target**: 20 actual service receipts from different shops
- **Sources**: 
  - Local automotive shops (ask for anonymized samples)
  - Online automotive forums (with permission)
  - Personal network (friends/family with redacted personal info)
- **Variety**: Independent shops, chains, different states, various conditions

### Step 2: Manual Baseline Testing (Day 3)
- Process each receipt through current `/api/vision/process` endpoint
- **Extract manually**: vendor, date, total amount, service type
- **Record**: What worked, what failed, confidence scores vs reality
- **No automation** - just spreadsheet tracking

### Step 3: Identify Top 3 Failure Patterns (Day 4)
- **Pattern examples**:
  - Faded thermal receipts (common failure)
  - Multi-column layouts (format confusion)
  - Handwritten totals (OCR struggles)
- **Quantify**: How often each pattern occurs

### Step 4: Targeted Prompt Optimization (Day 5)
- **Fix one pattern at a time**
- Modify OpenAI Vision prompts for specific failure cases
- **Test immediately** on same documents
- **Measure improvement** - did accuracy increase?

## Success/Failure Criteria

### Success Indicators
- **Current accuracy >70%** on vendor, date, total amount
- **Clear improvement** after prompt optimization
- **Identifiable patterns** that can be systematically addressed

### Failure Indicators  
- **Accuracy <50%** on basic fields
- **Random failures** with no discernible patterns
- **No improvement** after prompt optimization

## Decision Points

### If Successful (>70% baseline accuracy)
- Vision system foundation is solid
- Justify building more sophisticated testing infrastructure
- Expand to other document types systematically

### If Failed (<50% baseline accuracy)
- Vision system needs fundamental architectural changes
- Focus on core OCR improvements before expanding scope
- Question whether document processing is viable differentiator

## Resource Requirements
- **Time**: 5 days, manual work
- **Cost**: Minimal (no infrastructure build)
- **Risk**: Low (no premature optimization)

## Key Insight
**This validates whether the vision system foundation justifies sophisticated testing infrastructure, rather than assuming it does.**

**Next Action**: Source 20 real service receipts and manually test current extraction accuracy. No frameworks, no automation, just reality-based measurement.
