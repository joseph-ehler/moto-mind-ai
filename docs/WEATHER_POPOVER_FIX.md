# ✅ Weather Widget Popover Fix

**Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ Popovers getting cut off by overflow mask
2. ✅ Time context unclear (now vs historical)

## 🐛 Issue 1: Popovers Cut Off

### **Problem:**
```tsx
<div className="... overflow-hidden">
  <HoverCard>
    <HoverCardContent>
      [Content getting clipped!] ❌
    </HoverCardContent>
  </HoverCard>
</div>
```

**Why:** `overflow-hidden` on the weather widget container was clipping popovers

### **Fix:**
```tsx
<div className="... shadow-sm">  // Removed overflow-hidden ✅
  <HoverCard>
    <HoverCardContent>
      [Content fully visible!] ✅
    </HoverCardContent>
  </HoverCard>
</div>
```

**Result:** Popovers now display completely! 🎯

## 🐛 Issue 2: Time Context Unclear

### **Problem:**
**Before:**
```
Weather Conditions
Affects fuel efficiency & MPG
```

**User confusion:**
- "Is this current weather?"
- "Or weather at fill-up?"
- "Why does it matter?"

### **Fix:**

#### **1. Header Updated:**
```
Weather at Fill-Up
How conditions affected your MPG
```

**Clear:** This is historical, not current!

#### **2. Help Popover Clarified:**
```
Weather at Fill-Up Time
──────────────────────────────
This shows historical weather 
conditions at the exact time and 
location of your fill-up. These 
conditions affected your fuel 
efficiency during this tank.

💡 Compare weather across fill-ups 
   to understand MPG variations.
```

**Explicit:** Historical data from that moment!

#### **3. Attribution Updated:**
```
Historical weather at time of fill-up • Open-Meteo
```

**Reinforced:** Multiple mentions of "at time of fill-up"

---

## 🎯 User Understanding

### **Before (Confused):**
```
User: "Is this today's weather?"
User: "Why am I seeing weather?"
User: "When was this weather?"
```

### **After (Clear):**
```
Header: "Weather at Fill-Up"
Subtitle: "How conditions affected your MPG"

User: "Oh! This is from when I filled up!"
User: "This explains my MPG that tank!"
```

---
