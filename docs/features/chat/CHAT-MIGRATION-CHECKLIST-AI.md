## ⚠️  PRE-MIGRATION WARNINGS


### 🤖 AI-DETECTED ISSUES

**AI analysis found hidden complexity not obvious from file counts:**

- ⚠️  Dependency on external and internal components
- ⚠️  Prop drilling complexity for event data

**AI Recommendations:**
- 💡 Refactor to use a context or state management for event data
- 💡 Abstract external component imports to a single internal file

**Adjusted Time Estimate:** 2-4 hours  
**Confidence:** 52%

**Action:** Review these issues before starting migration. They may require extra time.


### 🔮 PREDICTED ISSUES FOR PHASE 1 (Tests)

**Based on historical data and AI analysis, these issues are likely:**


**1. Test failures after moving due to hard-coded paths or dependencies**  
Probability: 85%  
Mitigation: Update tests to use dynamic import paths and mock external dependencies accurately before migration.


**💡 Pro Tip:** Address these proactively to avoid debugging later.

---

## ✅ PHASE 1: TEST INFRASTRUCTURE (30 MIN)

**Goal:** Create comprehensive tests before moving any code.

### Step 1.1: Create Test Directories (5 min)
```bash
cd features/chat
mkdir -p __tests__/domain __tests__/mocks
```

### Step 1.2: Generate Domain Tests (15 min)

Create test files:

- [ ] `__tests__/domain/chat-validation.test.ts` - Input validation
- [ ] `__tests__/domain/chat-types.test.ts` - Type checking

### Step 1.3: Create Mock Fixtures (5 min)
```bash
touch __tests__/mocks/chat-fixtures.ts
```

### Step 1.4: Run Tests (5 min)
```bash
npm test features/chat -- --silent
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Minimum 10+ tests
- ✅ All tests passing

### Step 1.5: Commit
```bash
git add features/chat/__tests__
git commit -m "test: add chat feature tests (Phase 1)"
```

---

## ✅ PHASE 2: COMPONENT MIGRATION (25 MIN)

**Goal:** Move all UI components to `features/chat/ui/`.


### 🔮 PREDICTED ISSUES FOR PHASE 2 (Components)

**Based on historical data and AI analysis, these issues are likely:**


**1. Import resolution failures due to moved UI components**  
Probability: 80%  
Mitigation: Use module resolution configurations or update import paths before migration.


**2. Missing exports in components leading to build failures**  
Probability: 75%  
Mitigation: Perform a static code analysis to identify and fix missing exports before migration.


**💡 Pro Tip:** Address these proactively to avoid debugging later.


### Step 2.1: Create UI Structure (2 min)
```bash
cd features/chat
mkdir -p ui
```

### Step 2.2: Move Components (13 min)
```bash
# Move all components (preserving git history)
git mv components/chat/*.tsx features/chat/ui/
```

### Step 2.3: Update Imports (8 min)
```bash
# Bulk update imports
find app/ features/ lib/ -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | \
  xargs sed -i '' "s|@/components/chat/|@/features/chat/ui/|g"
```

### Step 2.4: Build & Validate (2 min)
```bash
npm run build
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Build passing
- ✅ No "Module not found" errors

### Step 2.5: Commit
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: migrate chat components (Phase 2)"
```

---

## ✅ PHASE 3: DOMAIN LOGIC MIGRATION (15 MIN)

**Goal:** Move business logic to `features/chat/domain/`.


### 🔮 PREDICTED ISSUES FOR PHASE 3 (Domain)

**Based on historical data and AI analysis, these issues are likely:**


**1. Type errors from moved files due to inconsistent typing across components and domain logic**  
Probability: 70%  
Mitigation: Standardize type definitions and interfaces before migration. Ensure all components and business logic use these standardized types.


**💡 Pro Tip:** Address these proactively to avoid debugging later.


### Step 3.1: Identify Domain Code (5 min)
```bash
grep -r "chat" lib/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v node_modules
```

### Step 3.2: Move Domain Files (5 min)
```bash
git mv lib/domain/chat-*.ts features/chat/domain/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 3.3: Validate (5 min)
```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

### Step 3.4: Commit
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: migrate chat domain logic (Phase 3)"
```

---

## ✅ PHASE 4: VALIDATION & DEPLOY (10 MIN)

### Step 4.1: Run Full Test Suite (3 min)
```bash
npm test features/chat
npm test
```

### Step 4.2: Architecture Validation (2 min)
```bash
npm run arch:validate
```

### Step 4.3: Complete Migration (2 min)
```bash
npm run migrate:complete
```

This will:
- Analyze results vs baseline
- Calculate actual vs estimated time
- Save to migration history
- Close migration session

### Step 4.4: Final Commit & Push (3 min)
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: complete chat feature migration

CHAT migration complete

RESULTS:
✅ Tests passing
✅ Build successful
✅ Architecture improved

Time: [actual time]
Complexity: MEDIUM
AI-Enhanced: Yes"

git push origin main
```
