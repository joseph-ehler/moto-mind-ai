### **Review Code:**

```bash
# Check for hardcoded API keys
grep -r "sk-" scripts/ --exclude-dir=node_modules

# Check for console.log of sensitive data
grep -r "console.log.*OPENAI" scripts/

# Check for unsafe file operations
grep -r "eval\|exec" scripts/ai-products/

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### **Issue: "OpenAI API key not found"**
```bash
# Fix: Set environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Or add to .env.local
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> .env.local
```

### **Issue: "Command not found"**
```bash
# Fix: Install dependencies
npm install

# Verify package.json has all scripts
grep "ai" package.json
```

### **Issue: "Module not found: ai-helper"**
```bash
# Fix: Check file exists
ls scripts/shared/ai-helper.ts

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### **Issue: Slow response times**
- Check internet connection
- Verify OpenAI API status
- Reduce prompt size if needed
- Consider caching results

### **Issue: High costs**
- Review prompt sizes
- Check for unnecessary API calls
- Implement caching
- Use cheaper models for simple tasks
