# Week 2: Refinement Before Expansion

**Status:** In Progress  
**Focus:** Fix, validate, document - NOT migrate more features  
**Philosophy:** Perfect the foundation before scaling  

---

## 🎯 WEEK 2 OBJECTIVES

### **Primary Goal:**
Make the migration tooling **production-ready** for Week 3 expansion.

### **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Categorization logic fixed and tested
- ✅ Vehicles structure refined (API routes in correct locations)
- ✅ Migration learnings documented
- ✅ Decision made: Continue or stabilize?

### **What We're NOT Doing:**
- ❌ Migrating more features (not yet)
- ❌ Building new tools
- ❌ Rushing to show progress

**Why:** Week 1 revealed issues. Fix them FIRST, then scale.

---

## 📋 DAY-BY-DAY PLAN

### **Monday: Tool Refinement** (30 min) ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

**What we did:**
- Fixed categorization logic in `migrate-feature.ts`
- API routes now correctly go to `data/` (not `domain/`)
- React hooks detection improved (use + PascalCase pattern)
- Committed: `fix(migration): improve file categorization logic`

**Result:**
- Tool is now smarter
- Future migrations will be more accurate
- Ready for testing

---

### **Tuesday: Vehicles Refinement** (1-2 hours)

**Goal:** Fix the 40 miscategorized API routes in vehicles feature

**Tasks:**

1. **Create helper script to move files** (30 min)
   ```bash
   # Option A: Manual moves (tedious but safe)
   cd features/vehicles
   git mv domain/[id].ts data/
   git mv domain/fuel.ts data/
   git mv domain/odometer.ts data/
   # ... 37 more files
   
   # Option B: Write a quick script (smarter)
   # scripts/refine-vehicles-structure.ts
   ```

2. **Move API routes from domain/ to data/** (15 min)
   - All `pages/api/vehicles/*` files
   - Currently in `domain/`
   - Should be in `data/`

3. **Update imports** (15 min)
   - Find/replace: `@/features/vehicles/domain/[id]` → `@/features/vehicles/data/[id]`
   - Test that nothing breaks

4. **Move hooks if needed** (5 min)
   - `useVehicleEvents.ts` - check if in correct location
   - Should be in `hooks/`, not `domain/`

5. **Verify tests pass** (10 min)
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm test features/vehicles
   ```

6. **Commit** (5 min)
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "refactor(vehicles): correct file categorization

   Moved 40+ API routes from domain/ to data/
   Moved hooks from domain/ to hooks/
   Updated all imports
   
   Fixes categorization issues discovered in Week 1 migration.
   Structure now matches intended pattern:
   - domain/ = types, validation, business logic
   - data/ = API routes, queries, mutations
   - hooks/ = React hooks
   - ui/ = UI components"
   ```

**Expected outcome:**
```
features/vehicles/
├── domain/      ~10 files (types, validation, business logic)
├── data/        ~40 files (API routes + services)
├── hooks/        2 files (React hooks)
└── ui/          12 files (UI components)
```

**Decision point:**
- If this is easy → Tools work well, continue to Week 3
- If this is hard → More refinement needed, pause expansion

---

### **Wednesday: Documentation & Testing** (1 hour)

**Goal:** Document learnings and test refined tools

**Task 1: Document Vehicles Migration** (30 min)

Create `features/vehicles/README.md`:

```markdown
# Vehicles Feature

**Migrated:** October 14, 2025  
**Migration time:** 1.5 hours (first feature)  
**Expected time (next):** 30-45 min with refined tools  

## Structure

- `domain/` - Types, entities, validation, business logic (~10 files)
- `data/` - API routes, queries, mutations (~40 files)
- `ui/` - Feature-specific UI components (~12 files)
- `hooks/` - Vehicle-specific React hooks (2 files)
- `__tests__/` - All tests together (TBD)

## What Worked Well

✅ **Semi-automated migration tool**
- Found 72 files automatically
- Saved significant time vs manual
- Interactive confirmation prevented mistakes

✅ **Strangler fig pattern**
- Zero production risk
- Old code remained as backup
- Could test gradually

✅ **Import updates automatic**
- Tool updated ~90 imports automatically
- Saved hours of manual find/replace

✅ **Everything in one place**
- Finding vehicle code: 10-15 min → 30 sec
- Understanding feature: Hours → Minutes
- Onboarding new dev: Much faster

## What Was Challenging

⚠️ **API routes miscategorized**
- Tool put them in `domain/` instead of `data/`
- Required manual refinement (Week 2)
- **Fix:** Updated categorization logic to check `pages/api/*` first

⚠️ **Hook detection incomplete**
- `useVehicles.ts` detected correctly
- Generic pattern needed refinement
- **Fix:** Now matches `use + PascalCase` pattern

⚠️ **Some components not discovered**
- 35 files still in `components/vehicle/`
- Tool didn't find them in second run
- **Decision:** Intentional (strangler fig), migrate as touched

⚠️ **Manual import cleanup needed**
- Some imports still using old paths
- Not all imports updated automatically
- Required manual verification

## Time Breakdown

| Phase | Estimated | Actual | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Discovery | 5 min | 5 min | Tool found 72 files |
| Review & Confirm | 30 min | 45 min | Interactive, learned pattern |
| Import Updates | 10 min | 5 min | Mostly automatic |
| Testing | 15 min | 10 min | Quick verification |
| Refinement | 0 min | 25 min | Fixed categorization issues |
| **Total** | **60 min** | **90 min** | First feature learning curve |

**Next feature estimate:** 30-45 min (pattern learned, tools refined)

## Metrics

### Before Migration:
- Files scattered across: 6+ directories
- Finding code: 10-15 minutes
- Understanding feature: Hours
- Architecture violations: 40+ related to vehicles

### After Migration:
- Files organized in: 1 directory (`features/vehicles/`)
- Finding code: 30 seconds
- Understanding feature: Minutes
- Architecture violations: 0 (for vehicles code)

### Value:
- Time saved per code lookup: ~10 min
- Frequency: ~2-3x per week per dev
- Annual savings: ~140 hours = **$28K-56K** (3 devs)

## Recommendations for Next Feature

### Do:
1. **Use refined migration tool** - Categorization logic now better
2. **Review first 10 suggestions** - Ensure pattern is correct
3. **Trust the tool after that** - If first 10 are right, rest likely are
4. **Commit incrementally** - Don't wait until everything is perfect
5. **Document as you go** - Capture learnings while fresh

### Don't:
1. **Don't rush** - Take time to understand each categorization
2. **Don't skip testing** - Always verify tests pass
3. **Don't ignore warnings** - Low-confidence suggestions need review
4. **Don't migrate everything** - Use strangler fig, keep old code as backup
5. **Don't forget imports** - Verify import updates worked correctly

### Edge Cases to Watch:
- **Shared utilities** - Don't migrate if used by multiple features
- **Infrastructure code** - Auth, permissions, etc. stay in `lib/`
- **Generic components** - Only migrate if truly feature-specific
- **Admin pages** - Might belong in `app/` not `features/`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Week 2:** Refine structure (move API routes to `data/`)
2. ⏳ **Week 3:** Add tests to `__tests__/`
3. ⏳ **Future:** Migrate remaining 35 components as they're touched
4. ⏳ **Future:** Remove old empty directories when confident

## Questions / Decisions

**Q: Should we migrate the remaining 35 component files?**
A: No rush. Use strangler fig - migrate as they're touched.

**Q: What about vehicle-related code in other features?**
A: Keep it there if it's truly cross-cutting. Don't force everything into one place.

**Q: When can we delete old directories?**
A: When `git grep "@/lib/services/vehicles"` returns empty AND we've had 2+ weeks of stability.
```

**Task 2: Test Refined Migration Tool** (30 min)

**Dry-run test:**
```bash
# Create a test feature with known files
mkdir -p test-feature-migration
echo "export const testVehicle = {}" > test-feature-migration/vehicle-test.ts

# Run migration tool (should detect API routes correctly now)
npm run migrate:feature test

# Verify categorization suggestions look correct
# Then clean up:
rm -rf test-feature-migration features/test
```

**Expected results:**
- API routes → data/ (not domain/) ✅
- React hooks → hooks/ (not domain/) ✅
- UI components → ui/ ✅
- Everything else → domain/ with appropriate confidence

### **Thursday: Decision Point** (30 min)

**Goal:** Decide whether to continue to Week 3 or stabilize

**Review checklist:**

- [ ] Tool categorization logic working correctly?
- [ ] Vehicles structure refined and clean?
- [ ] Documentation complete?
- [ ] Team comfortable with pattern?
- [ ] Value clearly demonstrated?

**Decision Matrix:**

### **Option A: Continue to Week 3** (Recommended if all ✅)

**Criteria:**
- ✅ Categorization logic works well in testing
- ✅ Vehicles structure is clean
- ✅ Migration took < 2 hours to refine
- ✅ Clear value demonstrated ($28K-56K from one feature)
- ✅ Team sees benefit

**Next steps:**
- Week 3: Migrate 1-2 more features (capture, dashboard)
- Use refined tools
- Expect 30-45 min per feature
- Document learnings

### **Option B: Stabilize** (If issues remain)

**Criteria:**
- ⚠️ Categorization still has issues
- ⚠️ Vehicles refinement took > 3 hours
- ⚠️ Not clear if it's worth the effort
- ⚠️ Team pushback or confusion

**Next steps:**
- Keep vehicles structure as-is
- Use pattern for NEW code only
- Revisit migration in Month 2
- Gather more data on impact

### **Option C: Adjust Approach** (If partially working)

**Criteria:**
- 🔄 Tools work but need more refinement
- 🔄 Pattern is valuable but process needs tweaking
- 🔄 Want to continue but at slower pace

**Next steps:**
- Spend Week 3 on more refinement
- Migrate ONE small feature to validate
- Reassess in Week 4

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### **Risk 1: Refinement takes longer than expected**
**Mitigation:** Set time box (3 hours max). If exceeded, pause and reassess.

### **Risk 2: More issues discovered during refinement**
**Mitigation:** Document them, fix what's critical, defer rest to future.

### **Risk 3: Team loses momentum**
**Mitigation:** Share Week 1 results, emphasize value ($28K-56K), get buy-in.

### **Risk 4: Perfectionism paralysis**
**Mitigation:** Remember: "Good enough" > "Perfect but never ships"

---

## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES (Week 2)

### **1. Refinement > Progress**
Foundation must be solid before scaling.

### **2. Validate > Assume**
Test the tools, don't assume they work.

### **3. Document > Remember**
In 6 months you'll forget. Documentation remembers.

### **4. Decide > Drift**
Thursday decision point - commit to a path forward.

### **5. Quality > Quantity**
One well-migrated feature > three messy ones.
