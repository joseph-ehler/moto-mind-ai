  vin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  year INTEGER,
  make TEXT,
  model TEXT,
  trim TEXT,
  specs_data JSONB,
  maintenance_schedule JSONB,
  repair_estimates JSONB,
  ai_insights JSONB,
  decoded_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **📊 Week 3: Database Integration**

**Purchase & Import:**
1. Buy databases ($4,100 one-time)
2. Import to PostgreSQL
3. Build query functions
4. Optimize indexes

**Expected Results:**
- VIN decode → Exact trim match

- AI recommendations → Data-backed

---

## 🤖 **AI INTEGRATION STRATEGY**

### **Use Cases (Prioritized by Value):**

#### **1. Vehicle Insights (Onboarding)** 🔥
```
When: After VIN decode
Cost: $0.002 per vehicle (gpt-4o-mini)
Value: Shows platform intelligence immediately

Example Output:
"Your 2019 Honda Civic is highly reliable with above-average 
resale value. Focus on maintaining the CVT transmission fluid 
schedule to avoid the $3500 replacement common at 120K miles."
```

#### **2. Maintenance Explanations** 📚
```
When: User asks "Why do I need this?"
Cost: $0.001 per explanation
Value: Builds trust, educates users

Example:
"Oil changes remove metal particles and combustion byproducts. 
Skipping this $45 service can lead to $4,000+ engine damage."
```

#### **3. Predictive Recommendations** 🔮
```
When: Based on mileage + service history
Cost: $0.003 per prediction
Value: Core product differentiation

Example:
"You're approaching 75K miles. Your Civic's timing belt typically 
fails around 100K miles ($800 repair). Schedule replacement now 
for $450 to avoid being stranded."
```

#### **4. Cost Negotiation Tips (Premium)** 💰
```
When: User gets quote from shop
Cost: $0.01 per analysis (gpt-4o)
Value: Premium feature justification

Example:
"Your $800 brake service quote is 30% above market average. 
Fair price is $550-600 for your vehicle. Consider asking for 
itemized pricing and shopping 2-3 shops."
```

### **Cost Analysis:**
```
Monthly (1000 active users):
- Onboarding insights: $2 (one-time per vehicle)
- Maintenance explanations: $10 (10 questions/user)
- Predictive recommendations: $30 (30 reminders/user)
- Negotiation tips (premium): $10 (1/user/month)

Total: ~$52/month = $0.052/user

Revenue: $5/user/month (freemium)
Margin after AI: $4.95 (99%)

AI is CHEAP! Use it liberally.
```

## 📱 **NATIVE APP CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Camera VIN Scanning:**

**Options:**
1. **Barcode Scanner** (VIN barcode under hood)
   ```typescript
   import { BarcodeScanner } from '@capacitor-community/barcode-scanner'
   
   const result = await BarcodeScanner.startScan()
   // Returns VIN string immediately
   ```

2. **OCR (Photo → VIN extraction)**
   ```typescript
   // Take photo
   const photo = await Camera.getPhoto()
   
   // Extract VIN with OpenAI Vision
   const vin = await extractVINFromImage(photo.base64String)
   ```

**Recommendation:** Implement both (barcode primary, OCR fallback)

### **Offline-First Architecture:**
```typescript
// Queue changes when offline
await queueChange({ type: 'add_vehicle', data })

// Sync when online
App.addListener('appStateChange', async ({ isActive }) => {
  if (isActive) await syncChanges()
})
```
