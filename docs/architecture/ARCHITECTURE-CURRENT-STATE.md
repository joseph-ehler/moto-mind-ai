## 🔴 TOP 10 ARCHITECTURE VIOLATIONS

From `npm run arch:validate`:

1. **95+ feature-specific components in `components/`**
   - Should be in `features/*/ui/`
   - Hardest to find and maintain

2. **15+ feature-specific libs in `lib/`**
   - Should be in `features/*/domain/` or `data/`
   - Business logic scattered

3. **6 API routes with deep imports (`../../../`)**
   - Should use `@/features/` path aliases
   - Fragile imports

4. **Empty `__tests__/` in vehicles feature**
   - No test coverage for migrated code
   - Risk of regressions

5. **111 timeline/event components not migrated**
   - Largest feature, still in old structure
   - High coupling risk

6. **40 capture components not organized**
   - Primary user interaction scattered
   - Hard to reason about flow

7. **15 vision components + 12 lib files scattered**
   - Core differentiator not cohesive
   - Hard to improve/optimize

8. **Mixed modals (19 items) across features**
   - No clear ownership
   - Duplication risk

9. **`components/ui/` has 62 items (mixed)**
   - Some shared, some feature-specific
   - Needs triage

10. **No feature READMEs**
    - Hard for new devs to understand
    - No documentation of feature boundaries

---

## 💰 COST OF CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

### **Developer Time Costs:**
- **Finding code:** 5-10 min per search (scattered locations)
- **Understanding features:** 30-60 min (no clear boundaries)
- **Adding features:** 2-3x longer (coupling issues)
- **Refactoring:** Risky (unknown dependencies)
- **Onboarding new devs:** 2-3 weeks (vs 1 week with feature architecture)

### **Annual Impact:**
- **Wasted search time:** ~50 hours/year
- **Slower development:** ~100 hours/year
- **Rework from coupling:** ~80 hours/year
- **Onboarding overhead:** ~40 hours/year per new dev

**Total Annual Cost:** ~270+ hours = **$40K-50K/year**

### **ROI of Migration:**
- **Investment:** 47-66 hours
- **Annual savings:** 270+ hours
- **Payback period:** ~2-3 months
- **5-year ROI:** 2,000%+

Week 1:  Complete vehicles (tests)        [████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 8%
Week 2:  Timeline + Capture + Vision      [████████████████░░░░] 42%
Week 3:  Garage + Maps + Monitoring       [████████████████████] 67%
Week 4:  All remaining + cleanup          [████████████████████] 100%
```

**Realistic estimate:** 4 weeks at 1-2 hours/day

## 🚀 NEXT SESSION (Tomorrow)

### **Phase 1: Complete Vehicles Feature**

**Goal:** Get first feature to 100% compliance

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Add tests to `features/vehicles/__tests__/`
   - Domain tests (types, entities, business logic)
   - Data tests (API, queries)
   - UI tests (components)

2. ✅ Migrate remaining vehicle components
   - Check `components/vehicle/` for stragglers
   - Move to `features/vehicles/ui/`

3. ✅ Verify no vehicle code in `lib/`
   - Check for scattered domain logic
   - Move to `features/vehicles/domain/`

4. ✅ Validate with `npm run arch:validate`
   - Target: 0 vehicle-related violations
   - Current: ~30 vehicle violations

**Success Metric:** 102 violations → 85 violations (-17)

**Time Estimate:** 3-4 hours
