# 🎯 Chatbot Enhanced Context + Event Card Display

## Overview
This enhancement provides the chatbot with **complete access to all event data** and adds **interactive event cards** that users can view directly in the chat.

---

## ✅ Part 1: Enhanced Context Builder

### **All Data Now Available to AI:**

**Before (Limited Fields):**
```typescript
{
  id, type, date, miles, cost, vendor, summary, notes, 
  location, gallons, weather
}
```

**After (Complete Data):**
```typescript
{
  // Basics
  id, type, date, miles, cost, vendor, summary, notes,
  
  // Location (Enhanced)
  location,              // "1 Goodsprings Rd, Jean, NV 89019"
  coordinates,           // { lat: 36.02, lng: -115.34 }
  
  // Fuel Details
  gallons,              // 33.18
  pricePerGallon,       // 2.970 (calculated)
  
  // Display Fields (Formatted)
  display_vendor,       // "Fuel Depot"
  display_summary,      // Human-readable summary
  display_amount,       // "$98.55"
  
  // Metadata
  created_at,           // When event was logged
  edited_at,            // Last edit timestamp
  payload,              // Raw extracted data from vision
  
  // Weather (Complete)
  weather: {
    temperature_f, condition, precipitation_mm,
    windspeed_mph, humidity_percent, pressure_inhg
  }
}
```

### **New Fields Added:**

1. **coordinates** - GPS lat/lng for mapping
2. **pricePerGallon** - Calculated from cost/gallons
3. **display_vendor** - Formatted vendor name
4. **display_summary** - Human-readable event summary
5. **display_amount** - Formatted cost string
6. **created_at** - Original log timestamp
7. **edited_at** - Last modification timestamp
8. **payload** - Complete raw vision data

---

## ✅ Part 2: Event Card Display System

### **How It Works:**

1. **AI detects event references** in conversation
2. **Automatically finds relevant events** from context
3. **Automatically renders event cards inline** in the chat
4. **Cards display complete event details** with clickable "View" button to full page

### **Automatic Detection:**

The system detects when users ask about:
- **Locations** - "Nevada", "NV", "Jean"
- **Dates** - "2020", "July", "5 years ago"
- **Event types** - "fuel", "fill-up", "gas"
- **General** - "event", "record", "fill"

### **Smart Matching:**

```typescript
// User asks: "Show me fuel-ups in Nevada"
// System automatically:
1. Detects "fuel" + "Nevada" keywords
2. Filters events: type === 'fuel' && location.includes('NV')
3. Renders event cards inline in the chat
4. User clicks "View" on card → Opens full event page
```

**Date:** July 9, 2020
**Location:** Fuel Depot - 1 Goodsprings Rd, Jean, NV 89019
**Cost:** $98.55
**Volume:** 33.18 gallons
**Price:** $2.97/gal
**Mileage:** 90,000 miles
**Weather:** 104°F, clear skies, 8 mph wind, 12% humidity

This was your only recorded fuel-up from Nevada in the system."

│                                            │
│ 📍 1 Goodsprings Rd, Jean, NV 89019       │
│ 🎯 90,000 miles                            │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────      │
│ 🌡️ 104°F  clear  💨 8 mph  💧 12%        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Event card renders inline automatically → Click "View" button to see full page**

## 🎯 Action Types

### **New Action: `view_event`**

```typescript
interface MessageAction {
  type: 'view_event'
  label: 'View 7/9/2020 in Jean ($98.55)'
  data: {
    event_id: '123-456-789',
    event_type: 'fuel',
    event_date: '2020-07-09',
    event_summary: 'Fuel fill-up at Fuel Depot',
    event_location: '1 Goodsprings Rd, Jean, NV 89019',
    event_cost: 98.55,
    event_gallons: 33.18,
    event_miles: 90000,
    event_vendor: 'Fuel Depot',
    event_weather: { temperature_f: 104, ... }
  }
}
```

### **How Event Cards Work:**

1. **Automatic detection** - System finds relevant events from conversation
2. **Inline rendering** - Event cards appear directly in chat messages
3. **Complete display** - All event details shown (cost, location, weather, etc.)
4. **Optional navigation** - Click "View" button to see full event page at `/events/{id}`

---

## 🔍 Detection Logic

### **Location-Based:**

```typescript
// User mentions: "Nevada", "NV", "Jean"
→ Filters: location.includes('nv') || location.includes('nevada')
→ Returns: Events in Nevada
```

### **Date-Based:**

```typescript
// User mentions: "2020", "July", "5 years ago"
→ Filters: date.includes('2020')
→ Returns: Events from 2020
```

### **Type-Based:**

```typescript
// User mentions: "fuel", "fill-up", "gas"
→ Filters: type === 'fuel'
→ Returns: Fuel events
```

### **Combined Matching:**

```typescript
// User: "Show me fuel-ups in Nevada from 2020"
→ Filters: type === 'fuel' && 
          location.includes('nv') && 
          date.includes('2020')
→ Returns: Specific fuel events matching ALL criteria
```
