### **3. Hover Tooltips on Each Metric**

**Every weather metric now has context:**

#### **Temperature (hover):**
```
Temperature Impact
────────────────────
Cold temperatures thicken engine oil
and reduce battery efficiency...

[Contextual based on temp]
```

#### **Rain (hover):**
```
Precipitation
────────────────────
Rain increases rolling resistance
and requires wipers/defrost,
reducing efficiency by 3-5%.
```

#### **Wind (hover):**
```
Wind Speed
────────────────────
Headwinds increase aerodynamic drag.
Strong winds (>25mph) can reduce
highway MPG by 5-15%.
```

#### **Humidity (hover):**
```
Humidity
────────────────────
Very high humidity can slightly
reduce engine efficiency. Low
humidity may improve fuel economy.
```

## 💡 Why This Matters

### **User Understanding:**

**Question:** "Why is my MPG lower this tank?"

**Without context:**
```
[Weather Widget]
72°F, Clear
5mph wind
```
User: "Okay... so what?" 🤷‍♂️

**With context:**
```
[Weather Widget - Enhanced]
Weather Conditions [?]
Affects fuel efficiency & MPG

☀️ 72°F, Clear
💡 Impact: Ideal conditions for
fuel efficiency - moderate 
temperature with minimal A/C use
```
User: "Oh! Weather affects my MPG!" 💡

---

## 📊 Contextual Messages

### **Cold Weather:**
```
❄️ 25°F, Snow

💡 Impact: Extreme cold can reduce
fuel efficiency by 15-25% due to
engine warm-up, thickened fluids,
and battery strain
```

### **Hot Weather:**
```
🔥 95°F, Clear

💡 Impact: Hot weather can reduce
fuel efficiency by 5-10% due to
air conditioning use
```

### **Rain:**
```
🌧️ 68°F, Rain

💡 Impact: Rain can reduce
efficiency by 3-5% due to
increased rolling resistance
```

### **Perfect Conditions:**
```
☀️ 72°F, Clear

✨ Impact: Ideal conditions for
fuel efficiency - moderate 
temperature with minimal A/C use
```
