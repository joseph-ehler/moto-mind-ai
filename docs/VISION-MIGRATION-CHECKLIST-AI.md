## ⚠️  PRE-MIGRATION WARNINGS


### 🤖 AI-DETECTED ISSUES

**AI analysis found hidden complexity not obvious from file counts:**

- ⚠️  Tight coupling between components and domain logic
- ⚠️  Potential for circular dependencies between components and domain logic

**AI Recommendations:**
- 💡 Refactor tightly coupled components to separate UI from business logic before migration
- 💡 Ensure proper dependency injection to avoid circular dependencies

**Adjusted Time Estimate:** 3-5 hours  
**Confidence:** 52%

**Action:** Review these issues before starting migration. They may require extra time.


### 🔮 PREDICTED ISSUES FOR PHASE 1 (Tests)

**Based on historical data and AI analysis, these issues are likely:**


**1. Test failures after moving due to hard-coded paths or dependencies in test files**  
Probability: 90%  
Mitigation: Update test configurations and paths; abstract or mock dependencies where necessary


**💡 Pro Tip:** Address these proactively to avoid debugging later.

---

## ✅ PHASE 1: TEST INFRASTRUCTURE (30 MIN)

**Goal:** Create comprehensive tests before moving any code.

### Step 1.1: Create Test Directories (5 min)
```bash
cd features/vision
mkdir -p __tests__/domain __tests__/mocks
```

### Step 1.2: Generate Domain Tests (15 min)

Create test files:

- [ ] `__tests__/domain/vision-validation.test.ts` - Input validation
- [ ] `__tests__/domain/vision-types.test.ts` - Type checking

### Step 1.3: Create Mock Fixtures (5 min)
```bash
touch __tests__/mocks/vision-fixtures.ts
```

### Step 1.4: Run Tests (5 min)
```bash
npm test features/vision -- --silent
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Minimum 10+ tests
- ✅ All tests passing

### Step 1.5: Commit
```bash
git add features/vision/__tests__
git commit -m "test: add vision feature tests (Phase 1)"
```

---

## ✅ PHASE 2: COMPONENT MIGRATION (25 MIN)

**Goal:** Move all UI components to `features/vision/ui/`.


### 🔮 PREDICTED ISSUES FOR PHASE 2 (Components)

**Based on historical data and AI analysis, these issues are likely:**


**1. 10 files with internal imports will need refactoring**  
Probability: 95%  
Mitigation: Create barrel exports (index.ts) or convert to absolute imports before moving


**2. Build failures due to unresolved dependencies after file moves**  
Probability: 85%  
Mitigation: Verify build configuration and paths; ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and imported


**3. Import resolution failures due to relative paths after moving files**  
Probability: 80%  
Mitigation: Use module aliases or update import paths after moving files


**4. Type errors from moved files due to incorrect or missing imports**  
Probability: 75%  
Mitigation: Ensure all imports are correctly updated and exist; consider using a static type checker


**💡 Pro Tip:** Address these proactively to avoid debugging later.


### Step 2.1: Create UI Structure (2 min)
```bash
cd features/vision
mkdir -p ui
```

### Step 2.2: Move Components (13 min)
```bash
# Move all components (preserving git history)
git mv components/vision/*.tsx features/vision/ui/
```


### ⚠️  CRITICAL: Fix Internal Imports (10 files)

**This feature has internal relative imports that WILL break during migration.**

**Affected files:**
- `components/vision/DashboardCaptureModal.tsx`
- `components/vision/DocumentScanner.tsx`
- `components/vision/DocumentScannerModal.tsx`
- `components/vision/index.ts`
- `components/vision/LicensePlateScanner.tsx`
- `components/vision/OdometerReader.tsx`
- `components/vision/RoutineDashboardCapture.tsx`
- `components/vision/VINScanner.tsx`
- `components/vision/VisionExamples.tsx`
- `components/vision/VisionProcessingWrapper.tsx`


**Strategy (choose one):**

**Option A: Barrel Exports (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create index.ts for internal exports
cat > features/vision/ui/index.ts << 'EOF'
// Re-export all components
export * from './ComponentA'
export * from './ComponentB'
// Add all components here
EOF

# Then update imports to use the barrel
# Before: import { X } from './ComponentA'
# After: import { X } from '@/features/vision/ui'
```

**Option B: Convert to Absolute Imports**
```bash
# Find and replace relative imports
find features/vision/ui -name "*.tsx" -exec sed -i '' \
  "s|from '\./|from '@/features/vision/ui/|g" {} \;
```

**VALIDATION:**
```bash
# After fixing, verify no relative imports remain
grep -r "from '\./" features/vision/ui
# Should return nothing
```


### Step 2.3: Update Imports (8 min)
```bash
# Bulk update imports
find app/ features/ lib/ -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | \
  xargs sed -i '' "s|@/components/vision/|@/features/vision/ui/|g"
```

### Step 2.4: Build & Validate (2 min)
```bash
npm run build
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Build passing
- ✅ No "Module not found" errors

### Step 2.5: Commit
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: migrate vision components (Phase 2)"
```

---

## ✅ PHASE 3: DOMAIN LOGIC MIGRATION (15 MIN)

**Goal:** Move business logic to `features/vision/domain/`.


### 🔮 PREDICTED ISSUES FOR PHASE 3 (Domain)

**Based on historical data and AI analysis, these issues are likely:**


**1. Circular dependencies due to tight coupling between components and domain logic**  
Probability: 70%  
Mitigation: Refactor to introduce an intermediary layer or use dependency inversion


**💡 Pro Tip:** Address these proactively to avoid debugging later.


### Step 3.1: Identify Domain Code (5 min)
```bash
grep -r "vision" lib/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v node_modules
```

### Step 3.2: Move Domain Files (5 min)
```bash
git mv lib/domain/vision-*.ts features/vision/domain/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 3.3: Validate (5 min)
```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

### Step 3.4: Commit
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: migrate vision domain logic (Phase 3)"
```

---

## ✅ PHASE 4: VALIDATION & DEPLOY (10 MIN)

### Step 4.1: Run Full Test Suite (3 min)
```bash
npm test features/vision
npm test
```

### Step 4.2: Architecture Validation (2 min)
```bash
npm run arch:validate
```

### Step 4.3: Complete Migration (2 min)
```bash
npm run migrate:complete
```

This will:
- Analyze results vs baseline
- Calculate actual vs estimated time
- Save to migration history
- Close migration session

### Step 4.4: Final Commit & Push (3 min)
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: complete vision feature migration

VISION migration complete
