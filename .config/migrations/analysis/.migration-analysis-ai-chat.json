    "estimatedTime": "0.5-2 hours",
    "reasoning": "Given the basic analysis provided, the chat feature appears to have a very straightforward structure with a single component, no subdirectories, and no internal imports, indicating a low complexity for migration. The lack of nested structures and internal dependencies simplifies the migration process significantly. However, chat applications can be sensitive to real-time data flow and UI updates, which are not explicitly covered by the provided analysis. These areas should be carefully tested after migration to ensure performance and functionality are maintained or enhanced. The estimated time is slightly adjusted to account for potential unforeseen issues in real-time communication handling post-migration.",
