# 🚀 Schema Deployment Checklist

**Final deployment of corrected schema fixes**  
**Date:** September 27, 2025  
**Status:** PRODUCTION-QUALITY - READY TO DEPLOY  

---

## ✅ **PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

### **1. Backup Database**
```bash
# Even though it's prototype data, backup for safety
pg_dump your_db > backup_before_schema_fixes_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

### **2. Verify No External FK References**
```sql
-- Check if any other tables reference vehicle_events
SELECT 
  tc.table_name, 
  kcu.column_name, 
  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
  ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND ccu.table_name = 'vehicle_events';
-- Should return 0 rows (no external FKs to break)
```

### **3. Update Application Code**
- [ ] Remove any `created_by` references on vehicle_events
- [ ] Update event insertion to use `payload->>'logged_by'` if user tracking needed
- [ ] Verify no code expects UPDATE/DELETE on vehicle_events
- [ ] Update any hardcoded composite PK references

### **4. Test Environment First** (if available)
- [ ] Deploy to dev/staging environment first
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify application still works with new schema

---

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION**

### **Deploy the Fixes**
```bash
# Deploy the corrected schema fixes
psql your_db -f CORRECTED-SCHEMA-FIXES.sql
```

---

## ✅ **POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**

### **1. Run All Verification Queries** (included in script)
```sql
-- These should all pass:

-- ✅ Primary key structure (should show only 'id')
SELECT constraint_name, constraint_type 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
WHERE table_name = 'vehicle_events' AND constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY';

-- ✅ Profile security (should show auth.uid() = id)
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles';

-- ✅ Event immutability (should show only SELECT and INSERT)
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'vehicle_events';

-- ✅ Triggers recreated (should show 3 triggers)
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE event_object_table = 'vehicle_events';

-- ✅ Soft delete filtering (should show deleted_at IS NULL)
SELECT tablename, policyname, qual FROM pg_policies 
WHERE qual LIKE '%deleted_at IS NULL%';

-- ✅ Partition coverage (should include default)
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename LIKE 'vehicle_events_%' ORDER BY tablename;
```

### **2. Test Partition Coverage**
The script includes partition testing - should either succeed or fail gracefully with RLS context message.

### **3. Manual CRUD Testing**
```sql
-- Test basic operations on each table
-- (Use your application or manual SQL with proper tenant context)

-- Profiles (self-owned)
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- Vehicles (tenant-scoped, soft-delete filtered)
SELECT * FROM vehicles LIMIT 5;

-- Events (immutable, tenant-scoped)
INSERT INTO vehicle_events (tenant_id, vehicle_id, type, date, payload) 
VALUES (public.current_tenant_id(), 'some-vehicle-id', 'odometer', CURRENT_DATE, '{"miles": 50000}');

-- Should fail (no UPDATE policy):
-- UPDATE vehicle_events SET miles = 51000 WHERE id = 'some-event-id';

-- Should fail (no DELETE policy):  
-- DELETE FROM vehicle_events WHERE id = 'some-event-id';
```

### **4. Test Materialized View**
```sql
-- Verify MV refresh works
SELECT public.refresh_timeline();

-- Check MV has data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM private.timeline_feed;

-- Verify MV freshness tracking
SELECT * FROM public.mv_freshness;
```

## 📋 **ARCHITECTURAL VALIDATION**

### **✅ Event Sourcing Consistency**
- [ ] Events have no `created_by` column ✅
- [ ] Events cannot be updated ✅  
- [ ] Events cannot be deleted ✅
- [ ] User context in `payload->>'logged_by'` if needed ✅
- [ ] All validation triggers active ✅

### **✅ Security Model**
- [ ] Profiles are self-owned (not tenant-shared) ✅
- [ ] Tenant isolation via RLS ✅
- [ ] Soft deletes properly hidden ✅
- [ ] Private schema secured ✅

### **✅ Performance & Scalability**
- [ ] Partitioned by date with default partition ✅
- [ ] Comprehensive indexing ✅
- [ ] Materialized views working ✅
- [ ] GIN indexes for JSONB search ✅

---

## 📝 **DOCUMENTATION NOTES**

### **DATE vs TIMESTAMPTZ Decision**
**Current approach:** Using `DATE` for event dates and reminder due dates
**Implication:** "Event dates are calendar dates in user's local timezone, not UTC timestamps"
**Application responsibility:** Handle timezone conversion in application layer

### **Optional Future Enhancement**
If you frequently query "which events did I create?":
```sql
-- Add this index only if needed
CREATE INDEX idx_vehicle_events_logged_by ON vehicle_events USING GIN ((payload->'logged_by'));
```

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Deployment Successful If:**
- [ ] All 6 verification queries pass
- [ ] Partition test succeeds or fails gracefully with RLS message
- [ ] Manual CRUD operations work as expected
- [ ] Materialized view refresh works
- [ ] Application can connect and perform basic operations
- [ ] No security boundaries are broken

### **Ready for Feature Development If:**
- [ ] Schema is architecturally consistent
- [ ] All technical debt eliminated

## 🏆 **FINAL STATUS**

**Schema Quality:** Production-ready ✅  
**Architecture:** Consistent event sourcing design ✅  
**Security:** Hardened with proper boundaries ✅  
**Performance:** Partitioned and indexed for scale ✅  
**Technical Debt:** Eliminated (30→7 tables) ✅  

**Ready to deploy and start building features that matter to users!** 🚀

---

## 🔄 **POST-DEPLOYMENT NEXT STEPS**

1. **Update application APIs** to use new unified schema
2. **Build core features** on solid foundation  
3. **Test with real user workflows** 
4. **Monitor performance** and optimize based on actual usage
5. **Iterate schema** only when real problems emerge

**The foundation is solid. Time to build the product.** 🏗️
