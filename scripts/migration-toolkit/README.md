## 🛠️ **CORE TOOLS**

### **1. Migration Orchestrator** (`orchestrate-migration.ts`) ⭐
**Purpose:** Main entry point for feature migrations

```bash
# Standard migration
npm run migrate <feature-name>

# AI-powered migration
npm run migrate:ai <feature-name>

# With Codex validation
npm run migrate:codex <feature-name>
```

**What It Does:**
1. Analyzes feature complexity
2. Generates adaptive checklist
3. Predicts issues
4. Guides migration step-by-step
5. Records patterns
6. Analyzes results

**Intelligence:**
- Learns from previous migrations
- Adapts checklist based on complexity
- Suggests optimizations
- Auto-detects patterns

---

###**2. Feature Migrator** (`migrate-feature.ts`)
**Purpose:** Execute feature migration

```bash
npm run migrate:feature <feature-name>
```

**Process:**
1. Create `features/<name>/` structure
2. Move files to appropriate subdirectories
3. Update imports
4. Create barrel files
5. Validate build
6. Update documentation

---

### **3. Complexity Analyzer** (`analyze-feature-complexity.ts`)
**Purpose:** Assess migration complexity

```bash
npm run migrate:analyze <feature-name>
```

**Analysis:**
- File count
- Import dependencies
- Export dependencies  
- Component complexity
- Estimated time

**Complexity Levels:**
```
🟢 LOW: 1-3 files, <5 imports, ~15-20 min
🟡 MEDIUM: 4-8 files, 5-15 imports, ~30-40 min
🔴 HIGH: 9+ files, 15+ imports, ~60-90 min
```

---

### **4. Adaptive Checklist Generator** (`generate-adaptive-checklist.ts`)
**Purpose:** Generate smart, context-aware checklists

```bash
npm run migrate:checklist:ai <feature-name>
```

**Adapts Based On:**
- Feature complexity
- Dependencies
- Historical patterns
- Known issues

**Checklist Types:**
- Simple feature (5-step)
- Medium feature (8-step)
- Complex feature (12-step)
- Custom checklist

---

### **5. Issue Predictor** (`predict-migration-issues.ts`)
**Purpose:** Predict issues before migration

```bash
npm run migrate:predict <feature-name>
```

**Predicts:**
- Import conflicts
- Circular dependencies
- Type errors
- Missing dependencies
- Build failures

**Confidence Levels:**
- High: 80-100% (act now)
- Medium: 50-79% (be aware)
- Low: <50% (monitor)

---

### **6. Results Analyzer** (`analyze-migration-results.ts`)
**Purpose:** Analyze migration outcomes

```bash
npm run migrate:complete <feature-name>
```

**Analyzes:**
- Actual vs estimated time
- Issues encountered
- Pattern matches
- Lessons learned
- Recommendations

---

### **7. Pattern Detector** (`detect-patterns.ts`)
**Purpose:** Learn patterns from migrations

```bash
npm run migrate:patterns
```

**Patterns Tracked:**
- Common file structures
- Import patterns
- Error patterns
- Time patterns
- Success patterns

**Learning:**
- Patterns → Predictions
- Predictions → Better checklists
- Better checklists → Faster migrations

---

### **8. Estimate Improver** (`improve-estimates.ts`)
**Purpose:** Improve time estimates

```bash
npm run migrate:improve
```

**Improvement:**
- Compares estimates vs actuals
- Adjusts algorithm
- Improves accuracy
- Builds confidence

---

### **9. Progress Tracker** (`track-migration-progress.ts`)
**Purpose:** Track overall migration progress

```bash
npm run migrate:track
```

**Metrics:**
- Features migrated
- Features remaining
- Average time per feature
- Total time invested
- Estimated time remaining

---

## 📚 **TYPICAL MIGRATION WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Analyze**
```bash
npm run migrate:analyze insights

# Output:
🔍 Feature: insights
📊 Complexity: LOW
📁 Files: 1 component
🔗 Dependencies: 0 imports
⏱️  Estimated: 15-20 minutes
```

---

### **Step 2: Predict Issues**
```bash
npm run migrate:predict insights

# Output:
✅ No circular dependencies
✅ No import conflicts
✅ No type errors predicted
💡 Confidence: 95%
```

---

### **Step 3: Generate Checklist**
```bash
npm run migrate:checklist:ai insights

# Output:
📋 Adaptive Checklist (LOW complexity):
1. Create features/insights/ structure
2. Move AskQuestion.tsx to ui/
3. Update imports
4. Create barrel files
5. Validate build
```

---

### **Step 4: Execute Migration**
```bash
npm run migrate:ai insights

## 💡 **BEST PRACTICES**

### **1. Always Analyze First**

# Don't guess complexity
npm run migrate:analyze <feature>
```

### **2. Use AI Mode**
```bash
# Let AI guide the migration
npm run migrate:ai <feature>
```

### **3. Record Patterns**
```bash
# Patterns make future migrations faster
npm run migrate:complete <feature>
```

### **4. Track Progress**
```bash
# Know where you stand
npm run migrate:track
```

### **5. Learn from Results**
```bash
# Improve estimates
npm run migrate:improve
```

---

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Import Errors After Migration**
```bash
# 1. Check barrel files exist
ls features/<name>/index.ts

# 2. Verify exports
cat features/<name>/ui/index.ts

# 3. Update imports using batch operations
npm run windsurf:batch replace-import
```

### **Build Failures**
```bash
# 1. Check TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# 2. Validate architecture
npm run arch:validate

# 3. Fix issues
# 4. Rebuild
npm run build
```

### **Pattern Not Learning**
```bash
# 1. Verify pattern recording
npm run windsurf:patterns show feature_migration

# 2. Record manually if needed
npm run windsurf:patterns record feature_migration success <duration>

# 3. Check confidence
npm run windsurf:patterns list
```
