    "estimatedTime": "40-60 hours",
    "reasoning": "Given the high component count, internal imports, and the presence of complex state management and internal dependencies, the migration is expected to be highly complex. The need for careful refactoring of imports, potential for hidden bugs due to shared state and types, and the challenge of maintaining feature parity and UX consistency contribute to the high complexity rating. The estimated time accounts for the need to refactor, test, and ensure that the migrated feature matches the functionality and performance of the original.",
