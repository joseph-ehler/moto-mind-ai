# Plugin System Testing Guide üß™

## Quick Start

We've built a **complete plugin system** with a live demo component for testing!

---

## üéØ How to Test

### Step 1: Add Demo Component to a Page

```tsx
// app/test-plugins/page.tsx (or any page)

import { PluginSystemDemo } from '@/components/design-system/utilities/file-upload/__tests__/plugin-system-demo'

export default function TestPage() {
  return <PluginSystemDemo />
}
```

### Step 2: Visit the Page

Navigate to your test page (e.g., `/test-plugins`)

### Step 3: Try Each Scenario

The demo has **4 test scenarios**:

---

## üìã Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Basic (No Plugins)**

**Purpose:** Verify FileUpload works normally without plugins

**Test:**
1. Click "Basic (No Plugins)" button
2. Upload any files (images, PDFs, etc.)
3. Verify files are added
4. Remove files
5. Verify they're removed

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ All file types accepted
- ‚úÖ No validation
- ‚úÖ Normal FileUpload behavior

---

### **Scenario 2: File Validation**

**Purpose:** Test the fileValidator plugin

**Test:**
1. Click "File Validation" button
2. Try uploading a small image (< 5MB) ‚Üí Should ACCEPT ‚úÖ
3. Try uploading a large image (> 5MB) ‚Üí Should REJECT ‚ùå
4. Try uploading a PDF ‚Üí Should REJECT ‚ùå
5. Check console for rejection messages

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Small images accepted
- ‚ùå Large files rejected with error message
- ‚ùå Non-images rejected with error message
- ‚úÖ Console shows: "‚ùå Validation failed..."

---

### **Scenario 3: Paste Support**

**Purpose:** Test the pasteSupport plugin

**Test:**
1. Click "Paste Support" button
2. Copy an image (screenshot, image from browser)
3. Press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Cmd+V (Mac)
4. Verify image appears in file list
5. Check console for paste event

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Pasted images are added
- ‚úÖ Console shows: "Image pasted from clipboard"
- ‚úÖ Works with screenshots
- ‚úÖ Works with copied images

---

### **Scenario 4: Combined Plugins**

**Purpose:** Test multiple plugins working together

**Test:**
1. Click "Combined Plugins" button
2. Paste a small image ‚Üí Should ACCEPT ‚úÖ
3. Paste a large image (> 10MB) ‚Üí Should REJECT ‚ùå
4. Upload a small image ‚Üí Should ACCEPT ‚úÖ
5. Upload a PDF ‚Üí Should REJECT ‚ùå
6. Check console for both plugin messages

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Validation runs on pasted files
- ‚úÖ Both plugins work together
- ‚úÖ No conflicts
- ‚úÖ Console shows validation + paste events

---

## üîç What to Check

### **Console Messages**

Open browser DevTools console and look for:

**Plugin Registration:**
```
‚úÖ Plugin registered: @motomind/file-validator
‚úÖ Plugin registered: @motomind/paste-support
```

**File Validation (Success):**
```
üìã Validating file: image.jpg
‚úÖ Validation passed: image.jpg
```

**File Validation (Failure):**
```
üìã Validating file: large-file.jpg
‚ùå Validation failed (max size): Image is too large! Max 5MB allowed: large-file.jpg (8.5 MB > 5 MB)
```

**Paste Events:**
```
üìã Paste event detected
‚úÖ Image pasted from clipboard
```

---

### **Event Log**

The demo component has a live event log showing:
- Scenario changes
- File additions
- Plugin events
- Validation results

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot find module './utils'"

**Cause:** Plugin utilities file missing or not exported properly

**Fix:** Check that `plugins/utils.ts` exists and exports functions

---

### Issue 2: Validation not working

**Cause:** Plugin not registered or hook not executed

**Fix:** 
- Check console for plugin registration message
- Verify `plugins` prop is passed to FileUpload
- Check `before-file-added` hook is defined

---

### Issue 3: Paste not working

**Cause:** Browser permissions or focus issues

**Fix:**
- Ensure page has focus (click on it first)
- Try Ctrl+V (Windows) or Cmd+V (Mac)
- Check console for paste event
- Try pasting a screenshot

---

### Issue 4: Multiple plugins conflict

**Cause:** Hook execution order or state issues

**Fix:**
- Check plugin order in array
- Verify each plugin returns correct values
- Check console for errors
