### **⚠️ Gaps (Opportunities)**

#### **1. Plugin Architecture** 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY**
```
Status: DESIGNED but NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

**What's Missing:**
- FileUpload plugin system (designed, not built)
- Vision plugin system (not designed)
- Integration adapters (not built)

**Why Important:**
Makes YOUR developers 10-20x faster at adding automotive-specific features.

**Examples You Can't Do Today:**
```tsx
// Can't do this yet:
<FileUpload
  plugins={[
    vinExtraction(),        // Auto-extract VIN
    damageDetection(),      // Detect damage
    qualityCheck(),         // Reject blurry photos
    autoFormFill(form)      // Auto-fill form
  ]}
/>

<VINScanner
  plugins={[
    vinValidation(),        // Real-time validation
    vinDecoding(),          // Auto-decode make/model
    confidenceScoring()     // Track accuracy
  ]}
/>
```

**Impact:** 85% faster feature development once built

**Recommendation:** Implement FileUpload plugins first (2-3 weeks)

---

#### **2. MotoMind-Specific Features Library** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
```
Status: MISSING - No automotive-specific plugin library
```

**What's Missing:**

```typescript
// You don't have this yet:
src/plugins/motomind/
├── automotive/
│   ├── vin-extraction.ts          ❌
│   ├── damage-detection.ts        ❌
│   ├── condition-assessment.ts    ❌
│   └── vehicle-classifier.ts      ❌
├── documents/
│   ├── title-extractor.ts         ❌
│   ├── insurance-reader.ts        ❌
│   └── registration-parser.ts     ❌
├── quality/
│   ├── blur-detection.ts          ❌
│   ├── lighting-check.ts          ❌
│   └── angle-validator.ts         ❌
└── workflow/
    ├── auto-form-fill.ts          ❌
    ├── quality-gate.ts            ❌
    └── completion-tracker.ts      ❌
```

**Why Important:**
Reusable automotive features across your entire app.

**Recommendation:** Build after plugin system (1-2 weeks)

---

#### **3. Barcode/QR Scanner** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
```
Status: MISSING - Would speed up data entry
```

**What's Missing:**
```tsx
// Can't do this:
<BarcodeScanner 
  types={['CODE_128', 'QR']}
  onScan={(code) => handleBarcode(code)}
/>
```

**Use Cases:**
- VIN barcodes (faster than OCR)
- Part numbers
- QR codes on dealer forms
- Shipping labels

**Benefit:** 3-5x faster than OCR for barcodes

**Recommendation:** Add when needed (1 week)

---

#### **4. Real-Time Validation** 🟢 **NICE-TO-HAVE**
```
Status: MISSING - Would improve UX
```

**What's Missing:**
```tsx
// Can't do this:
<VINScanner 
  livePreview={true}
  onLiveDetection={(vin, confidence) => {
    if (confidence > 0.8) showSuccess()
  }}
/>
```

**Benefit:** Immediate feedback, fewer retries

**Recommendation:** Add when UX testing shows need

---

#### **5. Damage Assessment AI** 🟢 **NICE-TO-HAVE**
```
Status: MISSING - Would add value for insurance/appraisal
```

**What's Missing:**
- AI-powered damage detection
- Severity classification
- Repair cost estimation
- Damage report generation

**Use Cases:**
- Insurance claims
- Vehicle appraisals
- Trade-in assessments
- Inspection reports

**Recommendation:** Add when business model expands to damage assessment
