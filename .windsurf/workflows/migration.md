# ðŸ”„ Feature Migration Workflow

**Use this checklist when migrating features to new architecture**

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Migration Analysis (AI-Powered)

**Before touching any code:**

- [ ] **Analyze migration complexity:**
  ```bash
  npm run migrate:analyze:ai <feature-name>
  ```
  
- [ ] **Predict potential issues:**
  ```bash
  npm run migrate:predict <feature-name>
  ```

- [ ] **Review AI analysis:**
  - Complexity score
  - Estimated effort
  - Key challenges
  - Dependency impact
  - Recommended approach

- [ ] **Baseline architecture health:**
  ```bash
  npm run arch:validate:ai
  ```
  - Record current health score
  - Note existing concerns
  - Will compare after migration

- [ ] **Map dependencies:**
  ```bash
  npm run windsurf:graph
  ```
  - Understand what imports this feature
  - Identify circular dependencies
  - Plan update order

---

## Phase 2: Migration Planning

- [ ] **Create migration checklist:**
  ```bash
  npm run migrate:checklist <feature-name>
  ```

- [ ] **Review generated checklist:**
  - File moves
  - Import updates
  - Type changes
  - Test updates

- [ ] **Estimate timeline:**
  - Small: 1-2 hours
  - Medium: 4-8 hours
  - Large: 1-3 days

- [ ] **Get user approval:**
  - Share AI complexity analysis
  - Discuss timeline
  - Confirm approach

---

## Phase 3: Execute Migration

- [ ] **Create feature branch:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b migrate/<feature-name>
  ```

- [ ] **Follow AI-generated checklist step-by-step**

- [ ] **For each moved file:**
  - Update imports
  - Update exports
  - Update barrel files (index.ts)
  - Verify TypeScript types

- [ ] **Run type-check frequently:**
  ```bash
  npm run type-check
  ```
  - If errors:
    ```bash
    npm run build:errors:ai <log-file>
    ```
  - Get friendly explanations
  - Fix quickly

- [ ] **Update tests:**
  - Update import paths
  - Verify tests still pass
  - Add new tests if needed

---

## Phase 4: Validation

- [ ] **Type checking:**
  ```bash
  npm run type-check
  ```
  - Should be clean (no errors)

- [ ] **Run tests:**
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
  - All tests passing

- [ ] **Architecture validation:**
  ```bash
  npm run arch:validate:ai
  ```
  - Compare with baseline
  - Health score should improve (or stay same)
  - Check for new concerns

- [ ] **Manual testing:**
  - Test feature in UI
  - Verify functionality unchanged
  - Check for edge cases

---

## Phase 5: Deploy Preparation

- [ ] **Deploy risk assessment:**
  ```bash
  npm run deploy:risk:ai
  ```

- [ ] **Review risk:**
  - Should be LOW (no logic changes)
  - If MEDIUM/HIGH, investigate why
  - Address concerns before deploying

- [ ] **Commit migration:**
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "refactor: migrate <feature> to new architecture
  
  Migration Summary:
  - Moved to: features/<feature>/
  - Updated: X files
  - Complexity: [AI score]
  - Architecture health: [before] â†’ [after]
  - Deploy risk: [LEVEL]
  
  All tests passing. No logic changes.
  "
  ```

---

## Phase 6: Post-Migration

- [ ] **Record pattern for future:**
  ```bash
  npm run windsurf:patterns record
  ```
  - What worked well
  - What was challenging
  - Time estimate accuracy
  - Lessons learned

- [ ] **Update context:**
  ```bash
  npm run windsurf:context decision \
    "Migration: <feature>" \
    "Migrated to new architecture. Complexity: [X]. Time: [Y]. Health: [before]â†’[after]. Learnings: [insights]" \
    "architecture" \
    "high"
  ```

- [ ] **Improve estimates for next time:**
  ```bash
  npm run migrate:improve
  ```
  - Helps AI get better at predictions

- [ ] **Update documentation:**
  - Feature README if needed
  - Architecture docs
  - Migration tracking

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

Migration is COMPLETE when:

âœ… AI complexity analysis validated approach  
âœ… All files moved to correct locations  
âœ… All imports updated correctly  
âœ… Type checking passes (no errors)  
âœ… All tests passing  
âœ… Architecture health maintained or improved  
âœ… Deploy risk is LOW  
âœ… Manual testing confirms functionality  
âœ… Pattern recorded for future migrations

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

**Do:**
- Run AI analysis first (know what you're getting into)
- Follow the generated checklist exactly
- Validate frequently (type-check after each change)
- Use Error Parser AI when stuck
- Record patterns (get better over time)

**Don't:**
- Skip complexity analysis (surprises are bad)
- Change logic during migration (refactor separately)
- Ignore architecture warnings
- Deploy without risk assessment
- Forget to record learnings

**Remember:**
Migrations are risky. AI tools help us:
- Predict complexity accurately
- Catch issues early
- Learn from patterns
- Ship safely

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues

### **Import errors after migration:**
```bash
# Use Error Parser AI
npm run build:errors:ai <log-file>

# Usually: Update barrel exports (index.ts)
# Or: Update path aliases in tsconfig.json
```

### **Circular dependencies:**
```bash
# Check dependency graph
npm run windsurf:graph

# Solution: Break cycles with event-driven patterns
```

### **Tests failing:**
```bash
# Update test imports first
# Then verify feature behavior
# Use Error Parser AI for cryptic test errors
```

### **Architecture health decreased:**
```bash
# Run validator to see why
npm run arch:validate:ai

# Address concerns before merging
```
