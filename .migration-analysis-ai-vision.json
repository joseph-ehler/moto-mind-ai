    "reasoning": "The migration involves not just moving files but also significant refactoring to separate UI from business logic. Given the high template complexity and the need to update internal imports carefully to avoid breaking changes, the process is more involved than the initial estimate suggests. Additionally, ensuring backward compatibility adds another layer of complexity.",
