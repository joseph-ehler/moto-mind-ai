/**
 * Migrations Hooks
 * 
 * React hooks for migration workflows (if needed for UI).
 * Currently a placeholder - migrations are primarily CLI-based.
 * 
 * Future hooks (if UI is added):
 * - useMigrationProgress() - Track migration progress
 * - useMigrationHistory() - View migration history
 * - useROICalculator() - Calculate migration ROI
 */

// Placeholder for future hooks
// Migrations are currently CLI-based dev tools
